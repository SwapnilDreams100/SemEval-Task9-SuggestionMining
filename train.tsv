663_3	1	a	please enable removing language code from the dev center language history for example if you ever selected ru and ruru laguages and you published this xap to the store then it causes tile localization to show the enusdefault tile localization which is bad
663_4	0	a	note in your csproj file there is a supportedcultures entry like this supportedculturesdederururu supportedcultures when i removed the ru language code and published my new xap version the old xap version still remains in the store with replaced and unpublished
664_1	0	a	which means the new version not fully replaced the old version and this causes me very serious problems
664_2	0	a	some of my users will still receive the old xap version of my app
664_3	0	a	the store randomly gives the old xap or the new xap version of my app
664_4	0	a	my app has a wp version and a wp version xap in the same submission
664_5	0	a	the wp xap works only on wp and the wp xap works only for wp
665_1	0	a	sometimes the store gives the wrong wp xap version of my app to windows phone users
665_2	1	a	it should be an option to remove the ru language code from my app language history or an option to completly replace fully replace the prevoiuses xaps
665_3	0	a	currently if you ever mistakenly selected a ru language than you will be in a very bad situation forever you can live with the wrong tile displayed for russian language in the store the english one or you can publish an update with the removed ru language but this update will not fully replace the old version and you will in truble
665_5	0	a	the store will randomly deliver the oldwrong version of your xap
665_6	0	a	i write a lot support ticket on this but no one really cares on this issue
665_7	0	a	the engineering team can solve this issue if they do one of the following
665_8	1	a	provide a workaround for removing the ru language from the language history i have no need for ru culture just for ruru but there is no way to remove ru from the language history if you ever posted your app with ru language support
665_9	1	a	or add and implement an appreslibdllxxxxmui for the ru language culture in the documentation appreslibdllxxxxmui exist only for ruru and not for ru culture thanks tom please enable removing language code from the dev center language history for example if you ever selected ru and ruru laguages and you published this xap to the store then it causes tile localization to show the enusdefault tile localization which is bad

669_1	1	a	its getting annoyingplease fix this
669_2	0	a	ive been working on an lob for my field of engineering civilstructural
669_3	0	a	the point is to make the app universal across devices so that our engineers do not have to spend too much time learning and relearning the controls
669_4	0	a	and because the same app runs on tablets and pcs our engineers can work in the field come back to their office and continue working with the same data on their pcs
670_1	0	a	because of windows and windows phone universal app i am hoping to adapt the app to windows phone as well
671_1	0	a	all the saved and live data are saved on onedrive to allow roaming between the devices
672_1	0	a	but ive found that windows phone file picker does not have access to onedrive and there is no futureaccesslist
672_2	0	a	this aspect alone prevents any adaptation of my app to the windows phone platform
672_3	1	a	please allow windows phone filefolder picker to have access to onedrive and store the location in futureaccesslist
673_1	1	a	also please allow onedrive folder to be stored locally like winrt
673_2	0	a	otherwise its not a real universal app
673_3	0	a	all the saved and live data are more
674_1	0	a	so far i have tried three different apps and i cannot access my pre windows phone photos
674_2	1	a	this needs fixing as a number priority
674_3	1	a	it would be nice to give developers the option put a payment on hold when they reach the appropriate threshold and have the option to put it on top of the next due payment when they reach the threshold after that
675_1	0	a	in wp dev preview theres a bug with the push service
676_1	0	a	when i am on mobile data connection i get all my notifications when i am on wifi there is no connection to the push server
676_2	0	a	no i found a workaround for myself when i turn off the mobile data connection manually the push over wifi works
676_3	0	a	but on wp gdr the system recognized automaticly which connection i am using and turn the push service automaticly on cellular or on wifi
676_4	0	a	everytime it works with wp dev preview it doesnt
676_5	0	a	when i try to insert a new bank account i receive an error because there is a validation that the bank account should be in the same country of my account
676_6	0	a	i think this is not correct because using paypal i can receive money in another country but i dont want pay extra costs for paypal and also i can insert my tax plan in a country different of my country in my account
676_7	1	a	please remove that validation or validate according with my tax plan and not my country in the account
676_8	0	a	there is another post that i voted because i cant change the country in my account

679_1	0	a	we were also able to switch between text messages and facebook messages on the fly
679_2	0	a	now with windows phone the app always has to open
679_3	0	a	on my lumia it takes significantly longer to do that now
680_1	0	a	its slow
680_2	1	a	please bring back the simplicity and efficiency of windows phone
680_3	1	a	while i was building a web application ive noticed that single page applications with this url will display blank page and only a refresh will load the page again can you please check that
680_4	1	a	it would be great if you would add a remoteid to the calendars
680_5	0	a	appointments have a remoteid but calendars dont
681_1	0	a	it would be easier to sync calendars if they have a remoteid like appointments
681_2	0	a	when the application is unpublished by microsoft the reason in sent by email
681_3	0	a	when the email is not received like in my case the developer doesnt know the reason
681_4	0	a	however this can be easily fixed by writing it in dev center
681_5	0	a	in winrt the tilebrush class is missing the tilemode and view properties that are present in other frameworks like wpf and silverlight
681_6	1	a	please add these properties so that we can support image tiling properly
681_7	0	a	there are tons of requests for this over the past years
681_8	0	a	see this thread for an example
681_9	1	a	the lockscreen text attribute should be separated out from tile attributes
681_10	0	a	to provide lockscreen text its necessary to use the widebackcontent attribute on the flip tile
681_11	0	a	but if you have generated a custom tile andor you dont want the tile to flip then you cannot use the lockscreen text feature
682_1	0	a	im trying to use the api for contacts in the namespace windowsapplicationmodelcontacts but it doesnt work as expected
682_2	0	a	first of all on windows phone i always get an ioexception when trying to call pickcontactasync
682_3	0	a	this is very strange since i was expecting to see at least contacts app to be launched seems theres some problem establishing the contract
683_1	0	a	i also checked the contacts permission was enabled on the packageappxmanifest
683_2	0	a	on windows rt che call to the pickcontactasync works but i receive wrong data instaed for example firstname and lastname are both in firstname and lastname is empty the importantdates eg
683_3	0	a	birthday are always set to low values like but if i try to navigate the contacts through outlookcom or contactspeople app i can see the right values
683_4	0	a	maybe i am missing something but this api seems to be broken
683_5	0	a	on windows rt che call to the pickcontactasync works but i receive wrong data instaed for example firstname and lastname are both in firstname and lastname is more
683_6	0	a	although it is possible to define custom etw events and to generate those events the publicly available tooling does not currently provide a way to get access to these events
683_7	0	a	the windows phone developer power tools only enable collection of predefined profiles that use certain system events
683_8	0	a	there appears to be no way to tell it to collect data from your own custom event sources
683_9	0	a	so although in eg netbased store apps the systemdiagnosticstracingeventsource class is available and can be used to generate custom etw events there doesnt appear to be any point to this at the moment because you cant actually record those events in a trace
683_10	0	a	just to be clear this is not a duplicate of as a reply in that thread points out you can already log etw events from a wp app
684_1	1	a	what i want is the ability to record those alongside systemprovided etw events so that i can see how my codes activity fits in with system behaviour

684_3	1	a	please get back the old onedrive integration to windows phone
685_1	0	a	it used to sync so fast and was able to view the pictures under photo albums easily
685_2	0	a	and now the app takes long time to load
685_3	0	a	the same happened with facebook integration
685_4	0	a	it used to be good on
686_1	0	a	we could minimize or maximize the pictures but now we can only maximize
686_2	0	a	i purchased the windows phone because of the smooth integration but now we are slowly moving towards apps and no os integration
687_1	0	a	microsoft provide a system event smsreceived for app to be notified when a sms received we also need such event for phone call such as phonereveived
687_2	1	a	moreover its better to have readonly api for phone call history so developer can help to make better phone call related app like android
687_3	0	a	make the mapicon of the windows phone sdk able to be on top by the use of zindex make the event tapped accessible for mapicon too
687_4	1	a	allow the messaging application to join in the default messaging application hub message for full interaction
687_5	0	a	applications use the api of the hub message for sendviewdeleteetc sms the message hub uses the api of others applications for the same thing sendviewdeleteetc messages
687_6	0	a	this means that the developper have the ablity to implement other application apis in the message hub and use it

690_1	0	a	this has broken my app swipe tunes as i hastilly submitted a wp update with transparent tile and realised later that fast resume was causing issues with my secondary tiles etc
690_2	0	a	fast resume has pretty much killed my app and i cant delete the wp xap from the store and as such it looks like my app will not be able to go back on the wp store or if it does it will have to be under a new name and abandon previous customers
690_3	1	a	please cant we have an option in the wpappmanifest file to untick fast resume and allow wp apps to not run in fast resume mode just like in wp
691_3	1	a	allow nfc capable windows phones to pay from the wallet app using nfc at locations where card readers support it
691_4	0	a	google wallet has been able to do this for almost years now
691_5	0	a	just youtube using google wallet at mcd
691_6	0	a	support for this would destroy any argument for an apple device because they arent going to do this any time soon and it would close the gap in functionality between wp and android

693_3	0	a	see for screenshots of this possible bug
693_4	0	a	ive seen some suggestions that are close to what we need but not quite and are marked as completed
693_5	0	a	i dont know why there is no support for current devices to read nfc cardstags in full at a low level
693_6	0	a	seems deceptive to say that the device has nfc capabilities if in reality it can only read a very specific type of tag
693_7	0	a	for one of our products we need to support nfc card readingwriting with existing devices and several types of cards mifare ul ulc calypso desfire maybe even more ive read that for wp the functionality will be added but only for devices with a specific nfc chipset which is currently not present in any of the devices
693_8	1	a	so please provide the lowlevel readingwriting functionality for nfc devices already in the field

694_3	0	a	when porting my windows app to windows phone i feel that the universal app template which is already awesome could do some other things to increase even more productivity create pages and usercontrol folders lets face it unless we want to create sh apps we wont have the same ui for all platforms so well end up creating the same pages and controls in both versions
694_4	0	a	vs could create those folders in each project and bring in the classes pages and user controls from the original project
695_1	0	a	i have stated the folder names i use pages and usercontrols but the rule could deal with other names as well
696_1	0	a	i use settingsflyouts and i took some time to replicate them as pages in the windows phone project
697_1	1	a	that could be automatic too
697_2	0	a	likewise top and bottom app bars in windows could be translated into the windows phone versions automatically if for example buttons were found in those controls
698_1	0	a	do the same for stylesxaml or whatever file contains templates and styles as done in
698_2	0	a	i believe that other kinds of automatic measures could be taken but i only remember these because i ported a very simple app
700_1	1	a	i recognize that when threshold arrives code matching between windows and windows phone achieves much of these may not matter anymore but for the time being these would be nice additions
700_2	0	a	i have stated the folder names i use pages more
701_1	0	a	i wished that pubcenter had a way of merging apps that i had in both platforms windows and windows phone which obviously includes universal apps
702_1	0	a	when using headphones music will pause if cortanta notifies you of an incoming text message

702_3	0	a	however podacasts do not pause and will continue to play inaudibly in the background as you interact with cortanta
703_1	1	a	this is a bug and should be fixed so that any media that is playing will be paused if you are interacting with cortanta
703_2	1	a	the trial feature should be builtin with automatic enforcement user prompting disabling etc just as it is in the windows store
703_3	0	a	in the windows store i can choose trial mode for my app and then pick the number of days i want the trial to last
703_4	0	a	from there everything is taken care of for me
703_5	0	a	if the user uninstalls during a trial it tracks this fact and prevents them from starting a new trial later
703_6	0	a	contrast this with the windows phone world where the developer indicates trial mode in the store but has to manually track the number of days since install whether the user has purchased etc
703_7	0	a	if the user uninstalls and installs again later the developer has no idea
703_8	0	a	adding trialmode in windows phone feels like implementandpray
704_1	0	a	i absolutely love the windows store implementation
705_1	1	a	with the two stores combining can we bring builtin trial mode support to windows phone
705_2	0	a	contrast this with the windows phone world where the developer indicates trial mode in the store but has to manually track the number of days more

709_2	0	a	it is quite hard to find a solution to something you never heard about before but with the right pointerskeywords it could be done efficiently and nearly effortlessly
710_1	0	a	as example for an obvious issue and easy solution if you know something about the problem my app failed certification because of darklight theme problems
712_1	0	a	i set the background to a fixed color black in the code and in the light theme the font color is set from white to black by windows phone automatically hence no text is readable
713_1	0	a	this problem occured at multiple tens of code places in my case
714_1	0	a	adding the following four lines to a report that probably has been sent out thousands of times would have saved myself more than an hour of searching for an efficient solution and reading this might help with darklight theme problems visibilityapplicationcurrentresourcesphonedarkthemevisibility or similar brushapplicationcurrentresourcesphonebackgroundbrush and maybe additional links to documentation it would be much less frustrating for windowswindows phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of windows windows phone

729_3	0	a	this gives them impression that my app is slow
730_1	1	a	i think microsoft needs to reconsider about having splash screens

730_3	0	a	let normal uris to be able to send notifications to the app using the windowexternalnotify and not only the uris

738_2	0	a	for this reason i insert widthbinding actualwidth elementnamehubevidenza modeoneway hubevidenza is name of root container a hubsection in the content of groupstyleheadertemplate
738_3	0	a	now it work butthe the header of first group is not displayed
739_1	0	a	this problem is the same on windows and windowsphone i have a listview with grouped items
740_1	0	a	now it work butthe the header more
742_1	1	a	provide a way to get list of installed applications on the phone
743_1	0	a	so acutally how the get respect the users regional format settings
743_2	0	a	i started the windows phone emulator with the following configuration for testing purpose ui language german region us format settings irish
743_3	0	a	i have found no way to get the information that the user has set his format settings to irish
743_4	1	a	and my only wish is to format a datetime like the user wants to see it
743_5	0	a	regional format does not automaticly mean the region i set the device to or the ui langauge i chose
744_1	0	a	on my devices i set the ui to english but want to see all timestamps and dates in the german format
744_2	0	a	but at the moment there is no way to get the setting the user made in the phone settings
744_3	0	a	on my devices i set the ui to english but want to more
744_4	0	a	apps on windows phone were able to run under the lock screen for quite some time
744_5	0	a	the new universal app model does not provide this functionality
744_6	1	a	this should be added in future versions as it is still an important feature for some apps
745_1	0	a	windows phone introduces the social extensibility framework
745_2	0	a	it allows thirdparty apps to integrate into the people hubs whats new feed etc
745_3	0	a	currently this integration is locked and only select app developers are given access
746_1	0	a	the documentation on the windowsphonesocialintegration namespace is also limited
746_2	1	a	i would like microsoft to open up this framework to all developers
746_3	0	a	i understand this framework is still being developed and realword usage must first be measured
746_4	1	a	but why not allow it to be used locally by sideloading or through the emulators
746_5	0	a	i think we could provide valuable feedback and come up with exciting scenarios for using this framework
746_6	0	a	i think we could provide valuable feedback and come up with exciting scenarios for more
746_7	0	a	i have create and export from my projects the win app and with the instructions you provide into your site i am trying to install the app to win
746_8	0	a	the cert
747_1	0	a	is installed successfully
747_2	0	a	but when i am trying to install the app i am getting an error
747_3	0	a	storeappappstudiowindowsanycpuappx
747_4	0	a	would allow binding to isvisible in an mvvm scenario
747_5	0	a	possibly some other property named parent to choose where popup is revealed from
747_6	0	a	again suitable for mvvm
747_7	1	a	id like to record an audiovideo file while playing a audio file in the background
747_8	0	a	the reason i got into this is because i figured if any company could do it microsoft could and then i find out that i cant
747_9	0	a	now my killer app has to wait for windows to catch up again
747_10	0	a	i dont know if you have to have two sets of speakers or two microphones or a way to separate left speaker from right but it would make a whole lot of devs happy to be able to do this
748_1	0	a	it is more convenient to go with swiping gestures is more fun being with than the tap method
748_2	1	a	however there should be more of swipe gestures than the tap methods
748_3	0	a	to set a difference a swipe to the right should launch settings menu as a swipe to the left launches the apps list
748_4	0	a	currently i am developing an app for posting photos to a users picasa account
748_5	0	a	a user has requested that the app provide functionality to edit a given photo from their account and upload a new version
748_6	0	a	i dont think its best of my resources to implement this functionality when there are so many great photo editing apps already on the market
749_1	1	a	i would like the ability to pass the photo from my app to an app of the users choice via an app picker that supports the selected photo type
750_1	0	a	the user can then do some function within the selected app eg
750_2	1	a	add a filter crop etc and then the opened app can pass that edited file back to my app
750_3	0	a	this would extend the power already available with share pickers to perform more generic tasks and would result in a better experience for the user
750_4	0	a	all this while keeping the sandbox mentality that the os has
751_1	0	a	this should be available both in winrt and silverlight applications
752_1	0	a	the user can then do some function within the selected app more
752_2	1	a	a thing that would be increbible is that your phone make a sound when you whistle or clap hands a certain pattern which could be preseted by the phone owner so when you cant find your phone and you dont have a buddy around to text you you can find it
753_1	1	a	lockscreen should be able to chose a tiny black outline around lettering so you can see whats written properly when you have a clearwhite lock screen
753_2	1	a	should be able to put transparent saved in pgn lockscreens like wp notification center should be able to control the screen when notification center is half open
754_1	1	a	should be able to control music play pause next previous song info directly from the notification center
754_2	1	a	xbox music should be able to swap music player sideways
754_3	1	a	pictures needs to open on albums instead of all the pictures mail center would be awesome if it opened on a page where you have a seperate for each of your accounts
754_4	0	a	then you chose with one to open
755_1	1	a	should be able to put transparent saved in pgn lockscreens like wp notification center should be able to control the screen more
755_2	1	a	could you please have a report that includes the prices before the final payment
755_3	0	a	companies need to have the correct sales estimate for the accounts purposes
756_1	0	a	windows sdk brought a lot of built in transitions making easier to develop a nativelike app
756_2	0	a	but i am missing that list animations seen on settings or messaging apps when opening or closing them
756_3	0	a	there are properties like isstaggeringenabled and isstaggerelement in the commonnavigationinfo class but the animations doesnt feel like the native one
757_1	0	a	thanks and keep up the good work with windows phone
757_2	1	a	make necessary conditions so that developers choose proper representing application high quality images as application symbols in store matching modern ui now many apps has simply ugly iconspixelatedandroid like pirated misleading
757_3	0	a	many times appsgames were made free for limited time as offers promotions
757_4	0	a	but we users misses outneed a category showing apps gone free price changelimited time offers like red stripe deals
757_5	0	a	ie in wp with all updates gives errordoesnt load page if the body tag contains onload windowlocation function ie
757_6	0	a	onloadwindowlocationapril
757_7	0	a	tried backup and restore yesterday
757_8	0	a	it seems wp does not backup and then restore all the apps
758_1	0	a	mostly nokias and heres apps some examples nokia camera here maps here drive were not backed up
758_2	0	a	i needed to install these manually
758_3	0	a	some other nokia apps that were installed by default when i bought the phone photo and video related apps were not restored either
758_4	0	a	also after i restored the phone here maps and here drive tiles had
758_5	0	a	sign and saying that these apps do not even exist in the store any more
758_6	0	a	but of course they exist in the store
758_7	0	a	i installed these manually later
758_8	0	a	some of my contact had different than default ringtone
758_9	0	a	those were not restored either
758_10	0	a	all contacts had the same ringtone
758_11	0	a	glance screen settings and when it goes to night mode were not backed up and restored
758_12	0	a	but of course they exist in the store more
758_13	0	a	i recently had to use this api for a private client certificate
759_1	0	a	and i was surprised to read in the msdn that it returns nothing as a result of its async call
759_2	0	a	i would really have thought it returns the just imported pfx
759_3	0	a	so here is my scenario and you can clearly see why this api change would help to improve the code flow var clientcert ensurecertficatesasync function loggertracechecking client certificate if clientcert loggerinfousing already loaded client certificate return winjspromiseasclientcert var certquery new certificatescertificatequery certqueryfriendlyname client cert return certificatescertificatestoresfindallasynccertquerythenfunctioncerts if certslength return windowsstoragestoragefilegetfilefromapplicationuriasyncmsappxcertclientpfx thenwindowsstoragefileioreadbufferasyncthenfunctionbuffer var pfx windowssecuritycryptographycryptographicbufferencodetobasestringbuffer loggerinfoinstalling client certificate return certificatescertificateenrollmentmanagerimportpfxdataasync pfx xxxxx certificatesexportoptionnotexportable certificateskeyprotectionlevelnoconsent certificatesinstalloptionsnone certqueryfriendlyname thenfunction this search in the store could be omitted loggerinfoclient certificate installed return certificatescertificatestoresfindallasynccertquery thenfunctioncerts return clientcert certs else loggerinfoclient certificate already installed return clientcert certs as you can see after installing the pfx i have to query the store again to fetch the pfx to use it in calls to httpclient with a filter
759_4	0	a	this is not a breaking change
760_1	0	a	current users are not expecting any return in the success continuation so they not check for any returned value
761_1	0	a	thanks for consideration

763_2	0	a	of wifis around not all are displayed or usable android devices work fine
763_3	1	a	please arabic keyboard not found in lumia please support an arabic
763_4	1	a	add xap support for some apps like explorer and opera
763_5	0	a	currently when sending a email using wp you can only attach a photo
763_6	1	a	the software needs access to sky one drive or a option so you can send files you have stored on there
763_7	0	a	common sense
763_8	0	a	could be very useful if i had the possibility to use an api to automatically disable the lock screen when approaching house or the reverse enable lock screen when leaving house
763_9	0	a	we can see this feature already in some operational systems
763_10	0	a	in some case if enterprise wants its signed app to be installed using in house touch kioskpcmachine then this should be possible using usb installation
763_11	1	a	add payoneer as a payment method for windows phone store windows store pubcenter earnings

765_1	0	a	note lg g xperia z all have snapdragon and support k video recording why not lumia phones
765_2	0	a	i think only software update require
766_1	0	a	currently in dd for windows phone iddfactorycreatewicbitmaprendertarget is strangely not supported
766_2	1	a	i would like to have one to be able to do hq software rendering using directd
766_3	0	a	to quote from windows phone web site windows phone introduces the ability to write certain drivers as usermode drivers by using umdf
767_1	0	a	with umdf you can write umdf drivers that use cstyle syntax and call many of the same methods that are available to kmdf drivers but this is limited to phone makers oems
767_2	0	a	however since phones are becoming more and more like pcs used to be and hardware extensions are starting to appear like the structure sensor which is designed to work with iphone and android
767_3	1	a	since umdf usb drivers are absolutely safe from harming the system thus guarding from penetrating the sp networks it would be a good idea to allow rd party registered device driver developers to be able to develop umdf signed drivers submitted for testing and approval for such devices as i mentioned before
768_1	0	a	since umdf usb drivers are absolutely safe from harming more
768_2	0	a	a app downloaded and to appear in report typically takes days or have a delay of at least hrs as per the support
769_1	0	a	we have amazing platforms performing at blazing speedsbenchmarked and good operation management framework in place
770_1	0	a	albeit it takes hrs itself is very slow but sometimes it takes days
771_1	0	a	dashboard reporting needs somebody accountable attention

785_2	1	a	a developer would like to ease the app submission process by being able to upload an app submission as a single archive package per submission
785_3	1	a	this archive could be a zip file should contain all of the metadata could be as an xml file and supporting files eg xap screenshots etc
785_4	0	a	that the store team needs to ingest the app and provide it to the store
788_1	0	a	apple provides a similar capability via itunes connect
789_1	0	a	this capability would not only enhance the submission experience but it would also allow for store submissions to be added and tracked in the developers source control system eg tfs git
789_2	1	a	optionally it would also be great for this capability to support selection of markets and price points that the app is intended to target
789_3	0	a	as a starting point it would be fine for the developer to download from the dev center a starter template that is a zip file with basic xml templates and placeholder filenames which the developer could then tweakmodify for the app she wants to submit
789_4	0	a	this capability would not only enhance the submission experience but it would also allow for store submissions to be added and tracked in more
789_5	0	a	i want to log a complaint on unequal developer treatment by dpe east africa
789_6	0	a	there is alot of unequal favoritism going on with regards to developer support on issues like windows testing devices
789_7	0	a	certain people request for devices and get immediately
789_8	0	a	unequal judging process based on friendship merits rather than app quality
789_9	0	a	any one here can see its down right nepotistic
790_1	0	a	i launch this complaint on behalf of others and in good faith
790_2	0	a	kindly i urge you to look at this matter
790_3	0	a	thanks in advance
790_4	1	a	support the windowsmediaediting api on windows
790_5	0	a	currently it is supported on windows phone only
791_1	1	a	change the cellularsim back to auto switch to wifi as preferred network the new manual data connection management is very annoying and result in hi data usage on the cellular network
791_2	0	a	http stack will help us to write complete web server inside phone that could be use for hosting webpage downloading files from phone via browser etc
791_3	1	a	you should be able to select a default application for certain functions
791_4	0	a	for instance i click a hyperlinked phone number and i am given the option to call with the phone or skype
791_5	1	a	i would like to be able to tell the system to always open with skype
791_6	0	a	same for maps youtube links website links that also have an app etc
791_7	0	a	currently a file is simply flagged as deleted
791_8	0	a	the file is not removed from storage
791_9	0	a	in todays criminalgovernment spy world simply flagging a file as deleted does not secure it from prying eyes
791_10	1	a	please consider adding an option to erase a file by overwriting the bits with garbage and also the catalog entryfile name
791_11	0	a	the actual erasure can be a background process
792_1	0	a	also consider adding a group policy to enforce erasure
792_2	1	a	hey please please make the classes in above framework like songcollection playlists etc immutable and unabstract
792_3	0	a	right now its impossible to create a custom playlist in a media player app without transferring all the songs to iso
792_4	0	a	it will be very easy if the classes are immutable and song collection class can be used simply as a list where one can add or remove song just like other collections so that mediaplayerplaysongcollection coll can be used more effectively
792_5	1	a	further extend background agent player to play not only audio tracks but song as well thanks

792_9	0	a	for some reason entering a number with a at the front in to the dialler task in an app in wp wp or wp results in the message please enter service codes directly from the phones keypad
792_10	0	a	this means i cant use gsm service codes in a dialler app eg
792_11	0	a	for settings conditional call forwarding which needs at the front
792_12	0	a	i love the universal app approach
792_13	0	a	but my wp app need an alarm
792_14	0	a	i found in msdn that the alarm manager class is not supported
792_15	0	a	so i have to stick to sliverlight
792_16	0	a	when will the alarm feature be implemented in winrt to support the phone
792_17	0	a	i found one interesting thing when i try to install my apps of different types wp silverlight wp silverlight and universal app to the sd card
792_18	0	a	first of all i set to store new apps on sd card in storage sense then start to install this three apps
792_19	0	a	after installation what i can see wp silverlight app it was installed on the phone but you can move it to sd though storage sense
792_20	0	a	wp silverlight app it was installed on the phone but you can not move it to sd though storage sense
792_21	0	a	universal app it was installed on the sd directly
792_22	0	a	universal app more
792_23	0	a	hate turning down games and music volume then i cant hear my phone ring later when i forget to turn volume back up
792_24	1	a	add more properties for gridviews controls
792_25	0	a	boolean adaptitemheight integer maxnumberofcolumns with adaptitemheight set to true the height of the gridviewitems can be variable
793_1	0	a	the item will adapt its height to the content
793_2	0	a	with maxnumberofcolums you can limit the number of columns
793_3	0	a	this property is especially usefull when adaptitemheight is set to true
793_4	0	a	im a bit surprise by the action center
793_5	1	a	i think it should have been thought more to be like bb hub
793_6	0	a	right now it just double the experience with what the live tiles provide
793_7	0	a	its nice to have a notification from a news for example and be able to read a short extract but it should go further in the experience dynamic and rich notifications displayed on a gesture on the left side of the home screen from edge swipe such as w does for apps running make the lock screen customizable with more than only app and make the icons openable on tap instead of unrolling the notif center form top i am a bit surprise by the action center
793_8	0	a	its nice to have a notification from a news for example and be able to read a short extract but it should go further in the experience dynamic and rich notifications displayed on a gesture on the left side of the home screen from edge swipe such as w does for apps running make the lock screen customizable with more than only more
793_9	1	a	it would be much more comfortable to be able to read the entire notification in the center of notifications for wp
793_10	0	a	currently its very hard to debug hybrid and webapps
793_11	0	a	when you create a webview you simply cannot see the dom or any normal information to see whats going on what goes wrong and why it goes wrong
793_12	0	a	platforms like ios and android now feature means to debug your webview via the desktopbrowser
793_13	0	a	when you connect an iphone to a mac you can view the webview from safari by going to developdebug
793_14	0	a	and voor android devices you open chrome and go to aboutdevices
793_15	0	a	this gives webdevelopers a very easy way to debug their applications and to see what goes wrong and with ie a lot can go wrong ie is better but still not as easy to make crossplatform apps run like on android and ios
793_16	1	a	having the means to inspect your app or site needs to be improved greatly
794_1	0	a	you can now only see the console but you need to manually put things in console as it doesnt show errors not even the dom
794_2	0	a	let alone inspect resources timeline and htmlcssjavascript errors
795_1	0	a	with frameworks like angular node jquery etc becoming more popular we really need means to debug our apps to provide the best web experience
795_2	0	a	this gives webdevelopers a very easy way to debug their applications and to see what goes wrong and more
796_1	0	a	currently apps can be transferred between accounts retaining i believe all ratings users app id etc
796_2	0	a	this can be done through a support ticket
796_3	0	a	however apps with inapp purchases are not eligible to be transferred
796_4	0	a	not even if the iaps are completely removed from the app and deleted from the developer account
796_5	0	a	if the app ever had an iap it is not eligible for transfer
796_6	0	a	i understand why this might not have been a high priority but as the platform grows it seems absolutely necessary
796_7	0	a	i have apps i would like to transfer which had iaps but i cannot do so
796_8	0	a	the reason i removed the iaps was to make the apps eligible for transfer
796_9	0	a	quite unfortunate
796_10	0	a	reasons to transfer an app transfer ownership to a different person or group ex an app is purchased by a different company
796_11	1	a	ideally it would be great to transfer an app including its iaps all intact
796_12	0	a	logistically i can imagine the nightmare that might be
797_1	0	a	at the very least if iaps are removed from the app and deleted from the dev account the app should become transferable
797_2	0	a	i have apps i would like to transfer which had iaps but i cannot do more

799_4	0	a	when you apply new policies on already existing especially if it is related to name all the existing credibility and market is lost
799_5	0	a	app is in store with current policies at that time there is no point applying new policies and make developer to work on old stuff
799_6	0	a	when you are developing an app the generic policies will make sense
799_7	0	a	but when a developer submitted an app and its failing for a reasonpolicies its worth sending a developer exactly what happened with hisher app
800_1	0	a	what are the things went wrong rather than saying your app failing on its generic message will be no use as the app is already developed reading these policies and with the understanding of these policies
800_2	0	a	if you simply say an app failed with the policy number or so what can a developer benefit out of it rather he will be more confused and after a couple of times it will be frustrating
800_3	0	a	after a little while developer may think that anyway they are not going thru whats the point in spending time here
801_1	1	a	be responsible and give more specific details why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things
801_2	0	a	may be this works with a firmcompany but for independent developers you are the source you are the helper
801_3	0	a	if you simply say an app failed with the policy number or so what can a developer benefit out of it rather he will be more more
802_1	0	a	windows phone default calculator is annoying without being able to copy and paste numbers into the calculator app
803_1	0	a	i find myself having to manually tab out get figures enter them in

803_5	0	a	copy any number of the internet documents and try and put it into calculator app
804_1	0	a	you will find you have to do it manually
805_1	1	a	i would be convinient if the copyandreplaceasync method would return something similar to the copyasync method
805_2	0	a	namely the file that was replaced
805_3	0	a	it would make chaining additional operations much more easier
805_4	0	a	having to re enter things like version number application name etc when submitting a new app is just grounds for making mistakes
806_1	0	a	in the app manifest ive already put the version number and ive already put the application name
806_2	0	a	when i upload this xap to the store look at the manifest and prepopulate the corresponding fields in my submission instead of giving me a chance to mismatch them

811_2	0	a	with windows phone i have a nokia lumia if i send an email with attached a small picture in the email that i receive the size of the attachment change depending on the body of the email
812_1	0	a	seems that the body is included in the image attached

812_3	0	a	currently when the dialogue with first level of windows phone store support is broken there is not any option to reach higher level and talk with someone who could resolve any kind of misunderstanding
812_4	0	a	windows phone support team can simply refuse further communication and everything stops there
812_5	0	a	and unbelievably they are doing exactly that
812_6	0	a	azure support system is a very good example how this should work
812_7	0	a	in every communication emails the support officers manager and generic escalation emails are included
812_8	1	a	please do the same for windows phone store unless you want to leave the developers and therefore the end users let down because of subpair support quality
812_9	0	a	microsoft has to understand that refusing adequate support to developers will strike back as thousands of customers who are using that same publishers applications will be left without further updates and improvements
812_10	1	a	please do the same for windows phone store unless you want to leave the developers and therefore the end users more

814_3	1	a	make the wallet app back to where it was i miss putting notes on the accounts and miss the bar codes and in other feedback anyway to get cortina to read emails too
814_4	0	a	when i play a video in silence it makes an annoying click sound when i want to skip a part of the video
814_5	0	a	on my lumia with wp
814_6	1	a	please develop a new type based on stringie
814_7	0	a	localizationstring that will harness the bing translator api at the time of download by lazy translating the text into the devices local language and saving the translation dictionary of that app for future downloads of that locality or retrieve the existing copy of the app in that locality
814_8	0	a	there are some bugs in notification centerif there are so many notifications in notification center then it lags when i scroll it down i dont know that others are facing this problem or not but i think its a major issue
814_9	0	a	i found something which i think of as serious security bug
814_10	0	a	ill start with the fact that ive got nokia l ith wp preview for developers
814_11	0	a	what else could be important is that ive set additional security code so ive got two codes first for sim card and second my own internal code which should be typed after a long time of phone inactivity
814_12	0	a	i noticed that after the reboot of my mobile phone i can skip sim code simply by pulling the screen down like clsing an app and then i only need to type my internal code in about cases sim code panel will pop up but in the other no
814_13	0	a	i can use all phone features except calling but getting access to other data is terrifying too
814_14	0	a	i checked it a few times
815_1	0	a	so my concern is that what will happen when someone uses only sim code
815_2	0	a	and what may cause that phenomenon
816_1	0	a	i noticed that after the reboot of my mobile phone i can skip sim code simply by pulling the screen down like clsing an app and then i only need to type my internal code more
817_1	0	a	currently windows phone is very restricted for developers
817_2	0	a	it is not at all flexible
817_3	0	a	whatsapp cant send audios truecaller cant interpret incoming calls we cant access the list of apps installed and numerous others too
817_4	0	a	all this is because of a simple reason security which is important in corporate companies but casual users are more out there
817_5	1	a	they shouldnt be restricted like this
817_6	1	a	so please develop two variants of windows phone os
818_1	0	a	enterprise which will be the one that we have today and a basic version will be more flexible more open for users and developers
818_2	1	a	make sd boot fresh each time phone is restarted or double files with nothing in them to play then error
819_1	0	a	start button for notification light calls msg all notification
819_2	0	a	when using mapelement derived controls such as mappolygon expose a tap event
820_1	0	a	in the event arguments allow some type of identification of the backing object such as the tag property
820_2	0	a	or dont make these objects sealed so that we can add the needed functionality ourselves
821_1	1	a	wp need to provide apis that allow developers to develop apps like app locker that locks specific appsusing phone with lock not enough
821_2	1	a	hi please add the from to options right after download new email under each email account to specify when the phone is allowed to check emails
821_3	0	a	due to some spam emails the phone alerts me about new emails in the middle of the night
821_4	0	a	its extremely annoying
821_5	0	a	even my old phone nokia e running on symbian had an opportunity to specify the time period during which new emails will be checked
822_1	0	a	the new geolocator api and implementation is so unreliable that it cant be used with any confidence in a product
822_2	0	a	problems i have encountered while using positionchanged event geolocatorreportinterval seems to be ignored
823_1	0	a	the simulator does a reasonable job of honouring the reporting interval phones seem to ignore it completely eg
825_1	0	a	reportinterval set to second the phone would regularly take seconds and sometimes minutes to report
826_1	0	a	as a developer i expect the reportinterval to be honoured with a high degree of accuracy
826_2	0	a	if the phone doesnt have an accurate location simply return what it does have
827_1	0	a	getpositionasync and getgeopositionasynctimespan timespan regularly never return
827_2	0	a	because the event based location reporting is unreliable i have tried to use these apis instead unfortunately they are also unreliable
827_3	0	a	the getgeopositionasync method will work maybe times in a row and then simply stop working and never return despite having a timeout parameter
828_1	0	a	in general the api is poorly designed
828_2	0	a	changing properties on an active gelocator causes exceptions
829_1	0	a	getting the geolocator to actually do something requires getting the magical and undocumented setting of properties correct and then attaching event handlers ie
829_2	0	a	the api is too implicit it works on sideeffect rather than deliberate commands
829_3	0	a	if the phone doesnt have an accurate location simply return what it does more
830_1	0	a	while i was trying to generate the project from the app studio it just hung
831_1	0	a	it is showing the status generating for the past hour
831_2	0	a	the online media extensibility is fantastic however it would be better if you allowed more sorting abilities for albums pictures and videos
831_3	0	a	currently the sorting is albums title acsending pictures albums creationtimestamp acesending it would be good if there was more sorting either via the photo hub or via code which allows all items to be sorted titlecreation timestamplast updated timestamp ascendingdescending

834_3	0	a	please
834_4	0	a	thanks
834_5	1	a	selecting apps updated message in windows phone notification center should jump directly to app download history instead of jumping to the store app but not showing the history
834_6	0	a	currently three additional but unnecessary actions are required to show the downloads history after apps updated was selected in notification center expand menu bar select downloads swipe to history
834_7	1	a	please provide a quick menu for windows phone something comparable to winx menu in windows but with possibility to edit and add menu items by the user
834_8	1	a	the menu should be triggered by pressandholding the standard windows key
834_9	0	a	that key combination is still free and the most logical place for a quick menu
834_10	1	a	make it possible to choose different sounds for different apps

834_18	0	a	i then used sharpdx for my app
834_19	0	a	i also couldnt create a mediaelement in codebehind because it needs a strange path for phones and throws an exception

834_21	0	a	as an app publisher in south africa i am currently unable to get any sort of proper tax invoice for purchases made through my developer account
834_22	0	a	this makes me incredibly unpopular with my accountant
835_1	0	a	would it not be possible to generate a simple invoice and email it to me
835_2	0	a	currently ms only seems to send snail mail invoices and only to certain countries way to go in leading the way with technology in business
835_3	0	a	anyway i am sure that i am not the only one who has this issue so if we could look at some email invoices it would be great
835_4	1	a	because i receive a lot of spam flashsms which i delete immediately i need a possibility to add phone numbers to blocked list manually
835_5	0	a	i cannot pick the number from unanswered calls or somewhere else because those numbers are not stored in my phone
835_6	0	a	hi currently wp allows to backup images so that low quality via data or high quality via wifi
835_7	1	a	for security reasons id really like to see an option that if the high quality backup via wifi is enabled and if the phone is not currently connected to wifi then the phone automatically creates resized smaller photo and uploads it via data to the cloud and then deletes the resized photo from the phone
835_8	0	a	then when the phone finds wifi and is able to connect it back up the original high quality picture and deletes the resized photo from the cloud too
835_9	0	a	hows that for security
835_10	0	a	lets assume the phone is set not to automatically connect every available wifi network or there is no free wifi available
835_11	0	a	if the phone is stolen and it is password locked its still possible to take photos if enabled
835_12	0	a	the thief may take a photo but if only the wifi backup option is enabled but there is no wifi available for the phone then the picture stays in the phone
835_13	0	a	but if it were possible to automatically resize the image in the phone and upload it via data then it would be available for the phones real owner
835_14	0	a	the thief could take a picture of himherself then it can be given to police andor give idea of hisher location
836_1	0	a	then when the phone finds wifi and is able to connect it back up the original high quality picture and deletes the resized photo from the cloud more

843_14	0	a	i understand that it makes sense to only show app reviews only in those countrys were they come from
843_15	0	a	eg
844_1	0	a	a german review should only be shown in germany and maybe in switzerland and austria
844_2	0	a	what i dont understand is that you also showing the app rating in countries were they come from
845_1	0	a	for example an app has ratings
846_1	0	a	from germany all with stars from usa star and from france stars if you now open the app in the windows phone store from germany you will see a total app review rating of stars
846_2	0	a	if you open the app in the us windows phone store it shows only rating with star
846_3	0	a	in france it shows ratings with stars and in all other countries it shows ratings
846_4	0	a	the total rating should be equal worldwide
846_5	0	a	i understand that it makes sense to only show app reviews only in those countrys were they come from

847_6	0	a	if a user has taken the time to mark pictures as favorites we should celebrate that and make it simple for developers to use that in their own applications
847_7	0	a	when you use the photochoosertask and specify a pixelwidth and pixelheight when an image is chosen the user is provided with a cropping tool that is outstanding and difficult to duplicate
847_8	1	a	please provide a photocroptask that takes an imagebyte and provides the same crop tool
847_9	1	a	include a pixelheight and pixelwidth as optional parameters so an aspect ratio can be included

848_1	0	a	i understand you have security considerations to consider however i cannot think of any reason we should not be able to check if a sms is received
849_1	1	a	extend the schedulednotificationrecurrencetype options beyond daily weekly monthly endofmonth yearly to allow more options for example every days every weeks every quarter every month etc

853_1	1	a	it would be cool to allow the applicationbar to have more icons available
853_2	0	a	so it could stick with the same row limit but could allow for wrapping so if there were items the applicationbar would expand to allow for the nd row of icons
853_3	1	a	it would be also cool to allow for more than one application bar per page so you could specify one at the top left bottom or right
855_1	1	a	the bottom could be quick links while the top or left side could be used for navigational purposes
855_2	1	a	please combine all windows phone skds into one installation file so people download only one file and then check each version of wp sdks that they want to install
855_3	0	a	it will help to reduce misunderstandings

856_1	0	a	hi i think its useful if both windows phone x and windows x will have a similar way to access filesystem content and implement all the apis here in particular having only the possibility of accessing media files through the xna api doesnt deliver a ux on par with other platforms

857_7	0	a	heres a use case example i am the author of bepuphysics a realtime simulation library
857_8	0	a	i wish to support many platforms as best i can with as much common code as possible
857_9	0	a	unfortunately in the current situation i cant have the best of both worlds
857_10	0	a	if my goal is optimal performance i must maintain separate codebases for a bunch of lowlevel queries and data structures
857_11	0	a	on the other hand if my goal is as much common code as possible i am forced to use the suboptimal lowest common denominator crippling all of the other platforms
857_12	0	a	over time these competing motivations have resulted in a codebase that is harder to maintain yet still isnt as fast as it could be
858_1	0	a	while using c could provide the necessary access and performance many of the potential uses in simulation are sufficiently finegrained that dropping to c from c repeatedly is at best horribly messy and at worst actually slower
858_2	0	a	a full native implementation would address the performance side of things but i cant justify the massive expense of porting for just one platform
858_3	0	a	it would also destroy a lot of value for the cbased users of the library
858_4	0	a	even if fallbacks had to be kept around to support other platforms that didnt allow unsafe code enabling unsafe code on the phone would allow it to use the same efficient implementations as the pc
858_5	0	a	this would be very useful in the resource constrained environment of a phone
858_6	0	a	on the other hand if my goal is as much common code more
858_7	0	a	when in a busy place cortano doesnt understand anything
858_8	1	a	please improve that
858_9	0	a	i often fiddle with the price of the inapp purchaseiap in my wp app to try and find the most profitable compromise between price and of purchases
858_10	0	a	at present i have to manually record when i change the price as there appears to be no way to track this in the dev portal which seems strange given all the other info that is provided in the exported excel file
859_1	1	a	ideally i would like to see a graph with both of purchases and purchase price plotted against time this would allow me to quickly see a change in rate of purchase vs price
859_2	1	a	ideally i would like to see a graph with both of purchases and purchase price plotted against time this would allow me to quickly see a change in rate of purchase more
859_3	1	a	i think there should be a casual genre section as a lot of apps dont fall into any specific section already listed
859_4	0	a	i installed the chinese quick keyboard
859_5	0	a	when i tried to use it to text someone the os keeps on crashing and restarting
859_6	0	a	nokia lumia windows
859_7	0	a	a lot of different apps are needed to wake up in exact time and do something
860_1	0	a	for example timer and alarm apps
860_2	1	a	so we need improvement timetrigger class with alarmapplicationmanager accuracy
861_1	0	a	and it should be possible to wait these triggers for many apps in the same time
862_1	1	a	for rss allow us to set custom settings for notifications and also allow us to enable the settings for users so they choose if they want notification or not
863_1	1	a	or allow infinite scrolling instead of default of items when a user scrolls down the list
863_2	0	a	youve forgotten to change that icon
863_3	0	a	at the moment anyone breaking through quiet hours does so at full volume
864_1	0	a	that could be disruptive in a meeting
864_2	1	a	why not add a setting to the inner circle that allows me to turn off the ringtone and let it vibrate only
865_1	0	a	just a simple switch that says to the os during quiet hours only use vibrate mode to alert me of a call or sms breaking through
865_2	0	a	the podcast app in windows phone if i stop a podcast and start another the bookmark for the previous podcast goes away and i have to search to find where i left off on the first podcast
866_1	1	a	please make bookmarks for podcasts persistent after moving to another podcast and coming back
866_2	1	a	it will be very useful if user can scan custom qr code from other screen or poster from phone search vision function and launch app via associated uri saved in qr code
866_3	0	a	according to documentation it is only possible using nfc
867_1	0	a	microsoft does not have its own direction navigation app
867_2	0	a	third party apps does not provide accurate direction
868_1	1	a	if they want to compete with android and iphone a good direction navigation system app is must on windows phone
868_2	0	a	i am liking windows phone that i bought a couple of days ago but if i cant use the phone as my gps navigation while driving its not good for me
868_3	0	a	it is best if photos can be processed on onedrive
868_4	0	a	the photo app on windows is not nearly good enough
868_5	0	a	i have an image x with file size kb and it does not load
868_6	0	a	load error
868_7	0	a	in the app dev archive the photos are x
869_1	1	a	hence some reasonable feature should be implemented on app studioonedrive to make this possible
870_1	0	a	i cannot get directions for transit and walk but for drive in the maps for wp
870_2	0	a	also it is pretty slow
870_3	0	a	currently the windows phone sdk installs all the components within the sdk including the emulator
870_4	0	a	however not all devices are compatible and the emulator images take up a large amounts of space and take lengthy times to download
870_5	0	a	users without compatible hardware are forced to download an unnecessary portion of the sdk without the ability to skip this feature
870_6	1	a	as such please make the installation of the sdk optional during the sdk installation
870_7	0	a	tile can shows video
870_8	0	a	manage my total apps purchase by deleting the unwanted apps from the total list similar like google store and also give the ability to filter my payment purchased apps
871_1	1	a	it would be helpful to be able to launch the calendar for a specific day ie i tell the user you have x appointments today would you like to review them
872_1	0	a	and then launch the calendar
872_2	1	a	i would like to be able to enable wp alerts be forwarded to xbox one when i am near it or manually configured for it
872_3	0	a	so if i get a cortana alert or new email and i am playing cod i can see it
872_4	0	a	nofificaiones center had to be moved from the left meego guy already looks better and cleaner and so would not be copied anyone since nokia who introduced this feature as bought a nokia also all in the family
873_1	0	a	if you shot a photo on native camera microsoft camera and see the photo on the app it dont delete a photo when you pick delete
873_2	0	a	on windows phone the store bug when we open the store applications list coudnt load
873_3	0	a	the store is unusable
874_1	0	a	windowsphone
874_2	1	a	allow apps to download data like pocket for offline viewing
874_3	0	a	in some places it is a problem that children are playing with their phones while in a class
874_4	0	a	there must be a way to handle this kind of problem like statistics on how many times an app was started or not being able to start applications other than some basic apps
874_5	0	a	the sd card support in wp is practically useless because builtin apps are the only ones allowed to access what are known as reserved file and uri associations
874_6	0	a	this means it is impossible to create an app that plays video or audio files stored on the sd card
874_7	0	a	many wp devices ship with only gb which makes the use of the sd card essential especially to store large files such as video
875_1	0	a	we are presently working on a wp version of an app to play sign language videos but are stymied by this restriction
878_1	0	a	we cannot read or even see any mp files on the sd card
878_2	0	a	this limitation basically stops our project for wp
879_1	0	a	of course we have ios and android versions that work on phones
879_2	0	a	our own project aside it seems somewhat draconian to disallow any thirdparty apps from competing with the builtin apps
879_3	0	a	just looking at the list of reserved file types seems like all file types known to man are reserved
879_4	0	a	and then i remind myself that this is just on the sd card
879_5	0	a	but then what is the point of the sd card if the developer is restricted to the phones internal memory
879_6	0	a	we cannot read more
879_7	0	a	there is ssltls socket support in windows phone
879_8	0	a	however currently no wp platform component seems to support ssl certificate pinning
879_9	0	a	when a ssl connection is created there is no way to inspect the x certificate chain returned by the remote server
880_1	1	a	i want to implement certificate pinning for additional security in my app and therefore i need an api to read the values of individual x certificates
880_2	0	a	i am not the only one who needs this please provide a way to do certificate pinning using platform components in wp
880_3	0	a	this is third time i am stuck in windows phone app development because windows phone doesnt provide a good background service
881_1	0	a	running of background service just for seconds every minutes is restricting app developers from creating required apps for clients
881_2	0	a	my client is a well known home appliances manufacturing company and they insist on regular update from app even when app is not running which we successfully implemented in android and ios
881_3	0	a	but because of the restriction in windows phone development over background service client is on the verge of dropping windows phone app for their product
881_4	1	a	so what i suggest is give flexible background service for development and notify user while installing the app about the background services that will be running and battery consumption it might causeand then user can decide to install the app or not
881_5	0	a	but because of the restriction in windows phone development over background service client is on the verge of dropping windows phone app for more
881_6	0	a	few days before updating the latest windows app studio i can still install into my phone
881_7	0	a	but after this new version and generation into wp and w i manage once with success installation but now cant be installed and always asked for install from store
881_8	1	a	it will be great if app can access files in documents dir
881_9	0	a	currently app can only access them through office
881_10	0	a	that made all document viewingediting app has a terrible user experience
881_11	0	a	and user may not understand how to open some type of files
881_12	0	a	if the microsoft force users to use office or force developers to use skydrive by this way may take the opposite result and lost users and developers
882_1	1	a	it would be greater if we could disable the close function while doing important tasks like writing to the storage or similar
883_1	0	a	however if the user closes the app during these processes the data might be corrupted
883_2	0	a	or for instance we are in a setup wizard we dont want the user to be able to close the app until the user has finished the setup
883_3	0	a	error report
883_4	0	a	i created my app in windows phone app studio
884_1	0	a	i choose in my phone the white theme and i see a problem the hidden menu doesnt show anything
884_2	0	a	when i choose black theme i can see all options in hidden menu
884_3	0	a	i dont know how to change this to make this works properly
884_5	0	a	some excellent tools to help find good cellular service like gsm monitor are not currently supported due to lack of an api to support the raw cellular data in real time
884_6	1	a	would be good if some of these tools could be developed by the support of cellular data in the network api
884_7	0	a	simply like in a windows
884_8	1	a	have an api for an application to interact with and listen for incomming connections from paired bluetooth devices while in background
884_9	0	a	one possible use case a smart watch that uses the phone as a way to access information in the internet
884_10	1	a	for the most time the watch is disconnected from the phone but from time to time it could connect to a service running on the phone maybe timed maybe because user presses a button on the phone to send a request which the service on the phone then handles some additional data transfer between the phone and watch and the phone and some cloud service may be involved the actual trigger from device to phone could be done with bluetooth le if listening for incomming spp connections is too much of a drain as long as it would be possible for an application to do some background processing and data transfer based on triggers comming from external hardware accessories
884_12	0	a	not being able to compile shaders at runtime is a huge inconvenience and prevents projects like angle from producing a fully compliant opengl port
884_13	1	a	please provide a api to get the signal strength of a particular bluetooth device so that we can estimate the distance between windows phone and the device
884_14	0	a	this can help us implement positioning in a small aera which just like what apple ibeacon does
885_1	0	a	its interesting and useful
886_1	0	a	silverlight doesnt work properly in ie so i cannot upload xap files using ie
886_2	0	a	i have to switch to google chrome to publish windows phone apps
888_1	0	a	i get the following message you dont have a supported version of silverlight installed
889_1	0	a	to get the latest version
889_2	0	a	if i try to update silverlight i recieve the message the same version is already installed
889_3	0	a	silverlight is enabled etc
889_4	0	a	application that will silence ringer between set hours but allow exceptions by contact and silence ringer during scheduled meetings from my linked calendars outlookcom googlecom yahoocom etc
889_5	0	a	it looks like instances of audiovideocapturedevice automatically dispose when an app is deactivated
889_6	0	a	the disposal appears to be done in the runtime code as none of my disposal code runs in these situations
889_7	0	a	this is an issue when the application returns to the foreground and activatedeventargsisapplicationinstancepreserved true because all application memory should be intact
889_8	0	a	but it isnt because the audiovideocapturedevice instance has been automagically disposed
889_9	0	a	this can be difficult to detect if the device is used in a deeply embedded object
889_10	0	a	my idea is that you are using tour own agenda and then notice the poor synchronising performance of it with google agenda
889_11	0	a	with other words it sucks
890_1	1	a	allow custom uris in internet explorer like nabtodevicecompanynet
891_1	1	a	basically implement the iinternetprotocol family of com interfaces on windows phone and allow us to add our own protocol handlers in the registry it is possible on windows
891_2	1	a	batterymanager should provide mechanism to tell us whether phone is plugged in ac or using usb
893_1	0	a	right now it only tells me whether the battery source is external or battery but external is too generic
894_1	1	a	itll be great to have batterysourceusb and batterysourceac when plugged in and batterysourcebattery when not plugged in
894_2	0	a	i recently asked myself how long an app takes to get in the store
894_3	0	a	especially if there are deadlines to fulfill it comes in very handy if there is a sort of progressbar indicating how many steps are necessary to get certified
896_1	0	a	all other steps are working really smooth but the pending certification is taking up to days without showing any progress
896_2	0	a	is there a way to add a progress ie
896_3	0	a	pending certification done in the account
896_4	1	a	that would be very nice for all the developers out there waiting for their app so become reality
896_5	0	a	at the moment there are only apis for reading and writing nfc tags
896_6	0	a	unfortunately this is only a very small part of the nfc capabilities
896_7	0	a	with an iso smartcard support you would be able to communicate with smartcards like being used in public transport or supporting payment via nfc credit cards
896_8	0	a	these capabilities are well supported by other platforms and i would like to see this support on wp too
896_9	0	a	have you ever decided not to download an app while browsing the store simply because it did not have any ratings or reviews
896_10	0	a	if so then this issue should concern you as a developer
896_11	0	a	the app store currently only shows consumers app ratings and reviews in the country that you live in
896_12	0	a	so for example if an app is published in canada and the united states and only the users in canada leave a ratingreviews then the users in the united states will not see those ratings and could potentially decide not to download the app
896_13	0	a	this also gives the false impression that your app is not good even though you know that people worldwide are enjoying or not enjoying the app
896_14	1	a	so i am suggesting that microsoft implement a system to show a consumer all the ratings and reviews
896_15	0	a	i understand there may be some issues with language etc
896_16	0	a	and an easy way to implement is to do this asides from bing translating wonderful app name user reviews worldwide reviews in your market this way a user can toggle between the world and local reviews
896_17	0	a	ratings and reviews are an important part of an app store otherwise why would microsoft bother having them
896_18	0	a	ratings and reviews are an important part of a developers promotion arsenal after all who would you rather believe the sellers ads or user reviews of the app
896_19	0	a	not all of us are the instagrams of the world and depend on each and every ratings we can get
896_20	0	a	so if you think it is only fair that users see all the reviews in the app store then please support this request by voting for it
896_21	0	a	this also gives the more
896_22	0	a	the idea is to install partially or all the data of the application to cloud services and not to the local device
896_23	0	a	currently there are no reports to show the purchases or downloads in realtime as and when it happens
896_24	0	a	this reduces the transparency as well as ability to verify transaction
896_25	0	a	this is one of the important feature required in windows phone dev report
897_1	1	a	remove the lock screen and make it a notifications screen where you can see everything that happened until interacted with on the phone by simply pressing the lock button on this screen and the logo of the application of the communication provides a small preview of a soft black and white and also allow us to access it only touched his notice
898_1	0	a	this implied that background applications in some cas updated costatemetesi presents many notifications have an application that only the logo appears and the number of requests for this application
898_2	0	a	we can get the contacts detailsfirst namelast nameimageemail idmobile number etc stored in the phone but not the group details like group namemember countmember names
898_3	1	a	for a phone hear and function called main so i need the driver api and identify the data call recording for example get the phone number to call to display information based on the number of phone customers prepare for new sales transactions over the phone
898_4	0	a	a virtual android application that allows the enduser to play and install android apps on a windows phone within the app
898_5	1	a	update the wpdev feedback app
899_1	0	a	i want to communicate with the sensors in my app when phone is in standby mode
899_2	0	a	blackberry has an android runtime that can be used to run android apk files and developers can port their android app to the bb os
900_1	1	a	i think windows phone should make that happen in conjunction with their supporting xamarin and potentially hire me as a developer to help
900_2	1	a	would like to change the view of the contact being displayed
900_3	0	a	in the current view i can hardly see the contact number or anything that i would like to focus
902_1	0	a	if there is a way to change the data template for the list and details of a contact that would be great
902_2	1	a	also i would like to add more extension points to the contact details that are currently captured
902_3	0	a	that i suppose is currently not possible
903_1	0	a	forex trading platform to windows mobile
903_2	0	a	currently there doesnt seem to be any possibility to disable the bounce effect when scrolling inside the webbrowser control which makes any apps based in html look and feel cheap
904_1	0	a	this happens when you try to scroll beyond the bounds of the control and there is the elastic effect which allows you to move the page beyond the border of the control
904_2	0	a	would it be possible to disable this
905_1	1	a	the software should allow javascript to be used through internet explorer
906_1	0	a	as websites cant use lightbox
906_2	0	a	ie littlewoods etc item images
906_3	0	a	skype contacts are cluttering up my people app and the only way i have found to delete them is to delete them on my desktop and then reset my phone to factory defaults
907_1	1	a	we need to be able to use third party bluetooth equipment
907_2	0	a	at least do file transfer and keyboards like everyone else
907_3	0	a	above could save hours spent on reading wrong answers
907_4	0	a	from an old suggestion which got declined phone off locked reminder comes up reminder is setup to open the owner app when tapped user taps over reminder then unlocks target app is not launched expected tapping over the reminder and then unlocking should take the user to the target app just as it works when the phone is unlocked and a reminder pops up
907_5	0	a	see i really hope microsoft can resolve this issue because it is clearly a bug and it definitely does not work as designed
907_6	1	a	i can understand that tapping on the reminder cannot take me to the app if the screen is locked but at least give me a possibility to unlock the screen
907_7	0	a	currently the only options i have is to close the reminder by tapping the snooze or ignore or the back button
907_8	1	a	if this is working as designed then i thing the navigationuri in the reminder is unnecessary and should be marked obsolete or the documentation should be updated with a limitations on the lock screen
908_1	0	a	furthermore without any scientific proofs i assume most reminders will arrive when the screen is locked so why have a feature that can only work for a fraction of the time
909_1	0	a	i can understand that tapping on the reminder more
909_2	1	a	please dont kill ram devices in the future with new update also ios still use full mhz cpu and its still good use some file paging on internal rom but dont kill the performance please
909_3	0	a	my internet explorer has stopped working
909_4	0	a	change the sound for typing
909_5	0	a	my nokia screen was unresponsive along with the screen buttons
909_6	0	a	i had to hold power button with volume down button in order to shut device off and reboot
909_7	0	a	upon reboot the screen and screen buttons are now responsive again
909_8	0	a	this is the third time in the past months i have encountered this problem
909_9	1	a	allow downloading of submissioned xap files in windows phone application publish submission process
909_10	0	a	currently you can add delete and replace file but cannot download xap file for easy reediting unzipmodifyzip after failed certification test or whatever other purpose
909_11	0	a	it is impossible to manage even a hanging indent because paragraph lacks margin and textindent properties
909_12	0	a	however hacking a hanging indent is not the real goal general support for bulleting
909_13	1	a	build support for bullets and numbering into the paragraph class with properties something like this numberstart int inherit from previous run numberstyle enum none bullet arabic letter roman numberflags enum flags uppercase dottedlevels numberlevel int make numberstyle default to none and all this is nonbreaking
910_1	1	a	provide an api to list all the installed applications in a wp devicethis functionality can be enable once the user enroll successfully through company app
910_2	0	a	as a musician i often get mps attached in emails when were in the process of recording mixing and editing music
910_3	0	a	i can only play them from the email directly but its not possible to save them to your phone memory
911_1	1	a	would be nice if that was possible
911_2	0	a	there is no serious tfs application on windows phone store
911_3	1	a	please give us api for tfs so we can connect to tfs server see all our projects and users manage tasks manage code versioning and etc
911_4	0	a	this is must have for a development tool
911_5	0	a	recently i read about new winphone features and one of the which had took my attention is the notification area
911_6	1	a	i think you need to make a different notification area
911_7	0	a	on the winpho video it works like android and ios
911_8	0	a	you pull from the top to down and the notification area appears
911_9	1	a	why dont you use the winpho style
911_10	0	a	for example to show the notification area you swipe from left to right
911_11	0	a	when a notification appears you have options swipe it from the left to right and brings the notifications area or swipe the notification from bottom to up to ignore it or press it to open the application related to the notification
911_12	0	a	this notification in my opinion will make winpho stills a different os from android and ios
911_13	0	a	i hope to contribute to a new vanguardist and different operational system in my smartphone
911_14	0	a	i hope you like it
911_15	0	a	thank you and best regards
911_16	0	a	when a notification appears you have options swipe it from the left to right and brings the notifications area or swipe the notification from bottom to more
912_1	1	a	facebook for winpho needs better integration with facebook
1205_2	1	a	it would be extremely helpful if the emulator could use webcams as camera emulation
1205_3	0	a	otherwise ar scenarios are hard to develop without a range of devices
1206_1	0	a	it has become even more needed with the addition of wxga and the different scalings in wp
1207_1	1	a	improve microsoft account login usability in app
1207_2	0	a	choose to login automatically with your microsoft account saved into phone also winrt without insert login and password again
1208_1	0	a	its so boring that you need do that also for microsoft apps like photosynth and skype
1208_2	1	a	i just want to tell you that it will be good if you give option to lock the applications specificallylike sms
1208_3	0	a	tldr creating a popular app is a bit of a chicken and egg problem
1209_1	1	a	it would be great to see this circumvented somehow
1210_1	1	a	one possibility instead of having a top charts style listing where the most popular apps are displayed to every phone anywhere create a new form of distribution where the results are randomized every time a user looks at the marketplace
1210_2	0	a	now that obviously has the result of bad apps being near the top a lot so you modify that with ratings
1211_1	1	a	highly rated apps should appear near the top more and they should appear less and less frequently and the rating of the app dwindles
1212_1	0	a	for example my app is currently fairly well reviewed stars
1212_2	0	a	however it never gets good visibility because it isnt the best which is actually subject to a very wide variety of opinions
1212_3	1	a	it seems to me that all good appsgames should have a chance at decent exposure in the top charts and waiting to be featured just isnt worth it
1212_4	1	a	another option is to do this with the featured apps in the marketplace
1212_5	1	a	instead of ten featured games per day which all users see it would be better for each user to see a random set of games each time the marketplace is viewed
1213_1	0	a	in this way every decent game would get a considerable amount of exposure each day while apps that had a rough beginning could mend their flaws and become successful apps
1214_1	1	a	there are a lot of reasons why this might be difficult but i feel that with a little bit of thought this could be a very profitable idea both for developers and for microsoft
1214_2	0	a	my two cents
1214_3	1	a	highly rated apps should appear near the top more and they should appear less and less more
1214_4	0	a	import alert tones
1214_5	1	a	need an api to hide cprogexe and bring other application to front ground
1214_6	1	a	please implement style triggers for windows phone xaml baml
1214_7	0	a	sometimes theyre much more useful than data binding for example when i need a staticresource as a property value
1215_1	0	a	as an app seller i have to deal with dissatisfied customers ever once in a while
1215_2	1	a	i want to be able to refund a purchase that a customer made both inapp products and paid downloads
1216_1	1	a	i need a way to remove files from my wp device which have been disliked
1216_2	0	a	since apps arent allowed to modify files on sd cards i wanted to write a desktop sync app that would examine the device for any files that have been disliked and then remove them
1216_3	0	a	however this is impossible with all existing apis
1217_1	1	a	if i have an app that shows a filtered subset of a users contacts i should have a way to click on that user and show the users details in the native experience
1217_2	0	a	i am familiar with the suggestion to take the contacts details and recreate them in your own ui which would be great if the api exposed all of the users details like the anniversary which it does not
1218_1	0	a	also having a showcontacttask would allow me to give my user a quick shortcut to post a message on twitter or facebook without having to implement those sdks especially since the apis do not currently give you access to social networking contacts to be able to pull their social network handles
1219_1	0	a	also having a showcontacttask would allow me to give my user a quick shortcut to post a message on twitter or facebook without having to implement those sdks especially more
1219_2	0	a	ocr sample app using project hawaii ocr api
1219_3	1	a	a sample project for using hawaii ocr api would be very helpful for the developersalso need help with how to use image preprocessing techniques and supported image processing libraries on wp to improve ocr accuracy
1220_1	0	a	i recently submitted an app but the process hung when i clicked submit
1221_1	0	a	i went through the whole process again but received the message that the alias was already in use
1222_1	0	a	thinking this meant that my app name was already being used by someone else i changed the name slightly
1222_2	0	a	this submission went through smoothly
1222_3	0	a	i later found that the original submission had also been successful even though it had hung so that there were now two duplicate submissions in processing certification with slightly different aliases
1223_1	0	a	i wanted to delete the extra one but but could not
1224_1	0	a	i could only change it to manually publish and hope to delete it later
1225_1	1	a	it would be much preferable to remove it from the certificatio nprocess
1225_2	0	a	i could only more
1226_1	0	a	currently we have access to external mass storage
1227_1	1	a	please provide access to internal too
1227_2	0	a	currently the only way to upload the user files to the iso storage is to use the cloudlike services skydrive
1227_3	0	a	it does not make a sense when the large multimedia files have to be transferred you first have to transfer them up to skydrive and then download to phone
1227_4	0	a	it would be great if the part of the application iso store could be made visible in the windows file explorer when the phone is connected by the usb cable
1228_1	0	a	currently only the media library is visible in this way and the access to the media library from app is very limited
1228_2	0	a	currently only the media library is visible in this way and the access to the media library from app is more
1228_3	0	a	i liked android and now bought htc s with a gb microsd to find out that app to sd is not supported
1228_4	0	a	i know that the copyright for apps schouldnt been touched but what about the app to internal memory and the needed files to microsd to support phones with short internal memory
1228_5	0	a	todays world where java is every where i dont know why wp does not support java based applications and why microsoft havent provided any way to develop wp applications in java
1228_6	1	a	please expose the id property for contacts and appointments
1228_7	0	a	at the moment it is private and inaccessible via reflection because of trust levels which makes unique contactappointment identification impossible
1228_8	0	a	any application that might want to backup contactappointments and thus would need to differentiate between entities via a unique identifier cannot exist
1228_9	1	a	please take this into consideration and make the id public maybe with a new capability requirement
1228_10	0	a	language problem
1229_1	0	a	if a listbox has elements with different sizes and you call scrollintoview to the last item the scrollviewer doesnt scroll to correct position
1229_2	0	a	you can reproduce it adding rectangles with px px and px of height and calling scrollintoview to the last item
1230_1	0	a	now on windows phone when we have resolutions taking screenshots may take a lot of time
1231_1	0	a	you have to run one emulator take screenshots close it and run another and so on
1231_2	0	a	we can scale wxga to wvgait still requires some work because they have the same ratio but we cant do this with p
1231_3	0	a	emulators are even slower than the wp ones so the process is really long
1231_4	0	a	consider also option where you have application in several languages
1232_1	0	a	you have to take screenshots in one language change it to another wait until emulator reloads and so on
1232_2	0	a	it takes a lot of time
1233_1	1	a	i would like to ask microsoft to give us a tooloption in emulator with which we can take screenshots once in one emulator and it will produce screenshots in all resolutions and all languages supported by our app
1234_1	0	a	it would save us a lot of time
1234_2	0	a	you have to take screenshots in one language change it to another wait until emulator reloads and so on more
1235_1	0	a	there is an very old bug that is still present in windows phone sdk when a page has a control that inherits from togglebutton for example checkbox systemiofilenotfoundexception is thrown and shown in the debug output
1235_2	0	a	one can read more here
1235_3	1	a	as an app developer working with custom bluetooth devices i need to be able to communicate with them in an unpaired scenario
1236_1	0	a	which i am able to do on ios android and jme platforms
1236_2	0	a	so something like peerfinderalternateidentitiesbluetoothunpaired
1237_1	1	a	a developer should have the possibility to write his own complete implementation of background audio player or the builtin one should at least provide the possibility of gapless playback or changing audio titlealbum without pausing playback
1237_2	0	a	as developing xna apps in windows phone development will not be supported anymore we sometimes need to have d models and work with them inside application without need to learn c direct x which will take alot of time and maybe valuable for game developers only
1237_3	1	a	so we need aupport for such feature in xaml code like in silverlight
1238_1	0	a	i want to create a app for incoming call recording but wp not provide any api for do this
1238_2	1	a	also need api for voice record with background agent
1238_3	1	a	provide api to easy save settings of an app online and restore after unnstall or resetchange phone using a microsoft account and online service skydriveazure
1239_1	1	a	allow users to take screenshots when the phone is muted without sound
1240_1	0	a	in wp the default pivot control now correctly displays the title text at the top of the page with the phonefontfamilysemibold and phonefontsizemedium styles but the standard blank page template still uses phonetextnormalstyle which uses the normal font weight and a slightly smaller size for the page title
1240_2	1	a	these page templates should be updated to use the mediumsized semibold font by default for the title text
1240_3	0	a	this change would encourage consistency with both the apps builtin to the os and within an app itself
1241_1	1	a	this should also be fixed in the wp sdk where all page templates including the pivot template still use phonetextnormal style for the title
1241_2	1	a	this should also be fixed in the wp sdk where all page templates including the pivot more
1242_1	0	a	haciendo que el celular del lumia se pueda utilizar como almacenamiento masivo como cualquier otro celular
1243_1	0	a	currently microsoftphoneinfodevicestatus is available to know the device manufacturer and it is only accesible from c project making it a round way about to include this project in c managed code
1244_1	1	a	it would be helpful if we have an equivalent api available in c
1244_2	0	a	if you are browsing web in your app and you reach a site protected by basic auth the control stops working
1244_3	0	a	it fires the navigating event but not the navigated event
1244_4	0	a	seems that it is waiting to receive credential but no popup is showed
1244_5	0	a	after this the control is no more usable the only option is to close the application and reload all
1244_6	1	a	allow a user to change the ring tone or sound of new txt messages coming to the phone
1245_1	0	a	after the to update i was so thankful that the arrow icon the arrow that takes you to the apps page even though you can just swipe the page
1245_2	0	a	was taken off to leave more room for the icons on the homescreen
1245_3	0	a	however there is still a mm gap at the top of the page not including the space for the time etc that is wasteful
1246_1	1	a	can you get rid of this space to enable more icons to fit to the homescreen
1247_1	0	a	its so annoying
1247_2	1	a	add a boolean to the cameracapturetask to optionally add the picture taken to the camera roll
1248_1	1	a	an app for online clothes shopping so that we are able to buy clothes from our phones should be made
1249_1	0	a	the webclient type doesnt allow me to use cookies stored by the web browser control and ill have to ask the user for credentials which theyve already stored in the form of cookies through the login page of a particular site in the web browser
1250_1	0	a	there is an indirect way of using browserhttp but its kinda buggy
1251_1	1	a	its not exposed by the sdk please fix it
1252_1	1	a	we need a way to save videos to the camera roll
1252_2	0	a	the leak of a medialibrarysavevideo method makes third party video apps very uncomfortable for the user
1252_3	1	a	it will be gode to can add custom sound to toas notifications
1252_4	0	a	if we can see the current voltage level we can determine if the phone is plugged in to usb power or utilizing an induction charger
1252_5	0	a	certain wp phones have wireless or inductive charging and we need to be able to calculate the efficiency of these chargers
1252_6	0	a	a thick phone case or simply not centering the phone on the charging plate can result in reduced charging capacity and much longer charging times
1252_7	0	a	adding visbility to the battery mah would then allow battery health apps charger comparisons and inductive charger efficiency or inneficiency
1253_1	1	a	for example allowing the user to view the time it would take to reach full charge on usb vs induction
1254_1	1	a	please add the capability to view voltage and mah or if possible another method to check if the device is charging with usb power or wireless power
1254_2	1	a	for example allowing the user to view the time more
1255_1	1	a	we need different sound levelssound level for system for alarm clock for musicradio and different for keyboard
1255_2	1	a	i want to have sounds enabled to keyboard but not at highest level also i want to listen to radio throuth the night and be sure that the next morning the alarm clock will sound as high as possible to wake me up
1255_3	0	a	i hope you get the point
1256_1	0	a	option to browse in private
1257_1	0	a	reminder api only allows the developer to repeat at least once in a day
1257_2	1	a	it would be nice to schedule a reminder to repeat at x hours
1257_3	0	a	currently it is impossible to pause in inprogress backgroundtransferrequest
1258_1	0	a	this would be beneficial for apps where multiple downloads may be running at once and the user wants to optimise the order in which they download
1258_2	0	a	the majority of apps i see at the marketplace doesnt have any reviews
1259_1	0	a	i think that has an overall negative effect user wise community wise and dev wise maybe you should think about some way to reward those users who take their time to actually try an app and review it
1260_1	0	a	i know that thinking up such a system isnt easy as you would have to think carefully about abuses
1260_2	0	a	there is currently no indication that an application is being featured it would be nice to receive a email prior to it being featured to indicate what dates countries it will be featured in
1260_3	0	a	so we can see all our emails in single app
1261_1	1	a	i think that there should be a nice feature were you can be able to slide the status bar down and view all the push notifications that you got but you didnt view just like android and ios but the best part is that it fixes many problems like when people wanted a short cut to turn wifi on and off and data on and off so that would be a nice feature to have
1261_2	1	a	i strongly think that more background colors should be there like instead of just black and white have blue red green and stuff like that and more accent colors
1261_3	0	a	keep tiles
1262_1	1	a	make it so the xbox app has smart glass in it without having to install the app directly but put the games in a different folder
1263_1	1	a	better music player i like the zune on interface or xbox music interface but i would like it so you can do more customization with it and have it so we can move a scroller on the bar that tells you how many minutes have you been playing the song so that we can skip through the music to our favorite part
1263_2	1	a	better people app i like the people app with the ui and the facebook twitter linkedin integration but the thing i would like most is if you made the top thing that said people was a smaller text it take to much space on the app
1264_1	1	a	make it so the tiles can be see through and the background can be a background image that would look nice
1264_2	1	a	better marketplace i would like a new ui
1264_3	0	a	keyboard is nice but when you do landscape mode on the keyboard the whole screen is not covered by the keyboard the status bar sort of shortens the keyboard so it would be nice if the status bar didnt interfere
1264_4	1	a	mobile teethering i would appreciate this to be on a new wp update for wp and wp but would be fine
1264_5	1	a	i strongly think that more background colors should be there like instead of just black and white have blue red green and stuff more
1264_6	0	a	in our video conferencing app network access seems to get shut down for a couple of sec approx
1264_7	0	a	every sec only when subscribed to geolocators statuschangedpositionchanged works fine otherwise
1264_8	0	a	does this have anything to do with wifi being one of location sources
1265_1	0	a	is there any way to select a location sources to use like on other platforms
1265_2	0	a	some especially for mobile useful css features like msscrollchaining snappoints and several others are missing from the phone version of ie which cripples the touch experience and requires additional and less smooth js libraries
1265_3	0	a	its especially frustrating while developing native html based apps
1267_1	1	a	please make an option like windows phone to mark several messages at the time of deletion as tapping and holding of every message and deleting take more time and it makes angry
1267_2	1	a	please make an option to mark messages for windows phone
1268_1	1	a	allow the use of desktop keyboard to interact with wp emulator similar to the current mouse functionality
1268_2	1	a	wish there was a way for mails contactscalendars etc to be pulled from an owa url into the email account definitions
1269_1	0	a	bb has this as a standard feature out of the box while rd party apps are available under ios though not half as good as the bb
1269_2	0	a	this is particularly helpful when activesync has not been enabled
1269_3	0	a	if the information is available from a browser it should be available to an app
1269_4	0	a	i want to be nice about this one but seriously
1270_1	0	a	why is it impossible to get the contact designated by the system as me for the purposes of getting my current picture
1270_2	0	a	why should i have to implement a contactpicker to make the user choose or implement the live sdk and force them to log in when the phone already knows
1271_1	1	a	i understand the reasoning for not allowing the user to have access to the mailboxes in the phone but there should be an api to enumerate through accounts and get their statistics like the number of unread emails number of important emails and the total email count
1271_2	0	a	there are more and more external sensors not only medical but all kind of proximity stuff for watches smart apliances cars and innumerable industrial applications that would pen the door to thousands of new apps
1271_3	0	a	as usual microsoft is late in this too and so we have to focus development on ios and android that have the sdk up to date with technology
1272_1	0	a	app will not upload photos
1272_2	0	a	only video
1273_1	0	a	we use microsoft expression encoder to do live smooth streaming video feeds
1273_2	0	a	i was surprised to find that the builtin media player doesnt support the html video element and live streaming
1273_3	0	a	video src it works on ios android and apple computers with safari
1273_4	0	a	since this is a microsoft technology or at least i thought it was i figured it would work wonderfully on window phone
1273_5	0	a	i can use a silverlight player program bitgravity player is what i am currently using but it requires me to type an address in
1273_6	0	a	its just one area that i cant recommend windows phones to people
1273_7	0	a	i used to be able to recommend windows mobile phones because we used windows media streaming server and it had windows media player
1273_8	0	a	its just one area that i cant recommend more
1273_9	0	a	you can retweet and answer tweets but you cant favorite
1273_10	0	a	the restrictions on the calendar editdelete are rediculous
1273_11	0	a	let the user decide if an app should have access to calendar files
1273_12	0	a	this rigid rule makes it impossible to make a functional rd party calendar app
1273_13	0	a	look at how much week calendar from utilitap have improved ios for several years before they made a better icalendar app
1273_14	0	a	i had decided to buy a wp phone but aslong as the calendar lacks so many functions and there is no hope of a better rd party app i will stick with ios or possibly android
1273_15	0	a	this is the most important feature lacking in wp
1273_16	0	a	by far
1273_17	0	a	this is the most important feature lacking in more
1273_18	0	a	let battery more efficientand alarm can work if the phone turned off
1273_19	0	a	that last update at the end of jan made the touch responsiveness on my nokia much worse
1273_20	0	a	the phone jumps to other pages when i am scrolling up and down
1273_21	1	a	wish i can undo that patch
1273_22	0	a	this would open the way for developers to create applications that will allow users to add unique colors to customize their device
1273_23	0	a	this is not about just having more colors in the them colors dialog but being able as a developer
1273_24	0	a	to add more colors to that list from your app
1274_1	0	a	windows phone includes a new map control
1274_2	0	a	it has a new feature to add a route that will be displayed under street names
1274_3	0	a	street names over the route will be shown in another color and are moved to stay always in center
1274_4	0	a	to add a route to the map you have to create maproute object that accepts only route object in its constructor
1274_5	0	a	but route object does not have public constructor
1274_6	0	a	the only possibility to create route is routequery class
1275_1	0	a	this is a problem
1276_1	0	a	routequery uses online service to calculate the route
1276_2	0	a	apps cant show the traveled route at real time on the map like jogging apps
1276_3	0	a	because they would have to be always online and query the online service frequently
1277_1	0	a	it is possible to workaround this with mappolyline
1277_2	0	a	but the polyline is shown over the street names
1277_3	0	a	street names color stays black and not being centered
1277_4	1	a	also if the new map has route feature it should be usable
1277_5	0	a	possible solution route class implements iroutepath
1277_6	0	a	maproute constructor should accept iroutepath inteface instead of route class
1277_7	0	a	apps cant show the traveled route at more
1277_8	0	a	the contact class is missing at least one data point the anniversary
1277_9	1	a	please make sure that any data accessible from the contact details page is made available to the contact class
1277_10	0	a	other folder continues to grow till phone storage is full
1277_11	0	a	now uninstalling apps also is not of much usea reset needs to be done
1277_12	0	a	when skype replaces messenger dont forget wp usersbackground push messaging
1277_13	1	a	improve its data base and functionality
1277_14	1	a	market it more as a visual assistant
1278_1	0	a	ex if you see a poster of a movie you want to see
1278_2	1	a	scan it and bing vision give you a list of the nearest theatres and show times or post a reminder in your calendar
1278_3	0	a	you see a ad for a pair a shoe you want
1278_4	1	a	scan it and bing vision give you a list of the nearest store that have them in stock
1279_1	1	a	as the current time sync does not work correctly at least in the netherlands i want the option to build my own
1280_1	1	a	allow zune music video tile in windows phone to fetch metadata and display artist images and artist names in india too settingsapplications lockwallpaper show artist image when playing music under lock screen
1280_2	0	a	this option is also not work until we have metadata of song ie
1281_1	0	a	artist image
1282_1	1	a	please make it available as it also makes the zune tile live
1283_1	0	a	the windows rt simulator lets you emulate multitouch interaction by exploiting the use of the mouse wheel
1284_1	1	a	it would be very helpful the same functionality also in the windows phone emulator
1284_2	1	a	add an option for remove the image in a contact
1284_3	0	a	big lack
1285_1	0	a	you can add an image but you cant remove it
1285_2	0	a	allow close the task on long press right button in phone
1285_3	0	a	sometimes phone is getting stucked while unlocking phone on my htc s
1286_1	0	a	windows phone may have new resolutions but it only actually has two aspect ratios scaling and scaling accessible through appcurrenthostcontentscalefactor
1286_2	0	a	because wvga and wxga are the same aspect ratio and because the website is a giant pita in uploading images you have to take and submit screenshots per actual screenshot per language
1286_3	0	a	screenshots in two languages turns into screenshots which is totally nuts
1287_1	1	a	if you guys employed a net module like imageresizingnet on your hosting clusters you could reduce it to screenshots per actual screenshot per language by only submitting wxga and p images and then autoscaling the wxga images down to wvga through an image handler
1287_2	0	a	that would significantly reduce the amount of effort a developer has to go through to publish an app
1287_3	1	a	if you guys employed a net module like imageresizingnet on your hosting clusters you could reduce it to screenshots per actual screenshot per language by only submitting wxga and more
1287_4	1	a	add support for office to directly send presentation to wireless projector
1287_5	0	a	i have a valid phone with its own microsoft account i have a valid developer account with another id i start up the windows phone registration app and no matter which of the two above entities i enter i keep on getting the pesky error device not registered with marketplace
1287_6	1	a	please return to the windows phone dev center for more information x message
1287_7	0	a	whats going on here
1287_8	1	a	i would like the option to schedule my mail synchronization
1287_9	0	a	so like from to my businesses mail should be synchronized on arrival but after business hours every hour or not at all
1287_10	0	a	hi i am developing an app that play remote mp file via internet using mediaelement
1287_11	0	a	this app has no issue on windows phone
1287_12	0	a	but on both windows phone emulator and device nokia lumia there are problems downloadprogress property often returned right after video if opened
1287_13	0	a	video size is gb so it must take long time to get value
1287_14	0	a	this problem happens randomly
1287_15	0	a	we can see the issue by playing youtube video or play video in metrotube tube pro app
1287_16	0	a	sometimes when i seek the video by changing position property ive got a trouble with infinite loop of buffering and video never play again
1287_17	0	a	i had to reopen video and change the position property again and sometimes this problem is disappeared
1287_18	0	a	please see the log text below to understand circumstance
1287_19	0	a	this problem also happen randomly
1287_20	0	a	once again these problems do not happen on wp so id like to see if these are known issues on wp os and hope to see the fix soon
1288_1	0	a	one more issue seeking and opening video time in windows phone are quite long in comparison with ios

1304_1	1	a	id love to have the option of autocapitalising the letter i when its typed on its own
1304_2	0	a	this must be one of the most basic autocorrects
1304_3	1	a	also it would be really useful to have an apostrophe available on the main text entry screen
1304_4	0	a	it is used a lot almost as much as the comma and full stop
1304_5	0	a	lastly you can enter a full stop and a space by hitting space twice like this
1304_6	0	a	but look what happens when i try note the lower case i to use the autocomplete which is set to add a space after being used it wont subsequently recognise the double space like so this should be new sentence but instead i have three spaces
1304_7	0	a	but look what happens when i try note the lower case i to use the autocomplete which is set to add a space after being used it more
1304_8	1	a	allow us to query device information from a native c application so we are not forced to use c
1304_9	0	a	windows app development freedom
1304_10	0	a	my game icon was designed to have a transparent background but when i published it and saw it listed in the game hub the transparent background was not filled with the users theme color as it would have been in the app list or when pinned to the home screen
1304_11	1	a	please add support for icons with a transparent background in the games list
1304_12	0	a	vpn
1304_13	0	a	cant work without it
1306_1	0	a	when accidentally hitting x button while typing email offer cancel in addition to save and delete
1306_2	0	a	adding this api would make room for rdparty messaging apps and phone management apps
1306_3	0	a	like connectionsettingstask this task permit to open localization settings page from application
1306_4	0	a	this task is useful for app that use bing map that must check is localization service is active and permit to offer to user an shortcut to edit this setting like standard map app
1306_5	0	a	partiendo de nada conectar con el todo
1308_1	0	a	hi as we know there is a lot of limitations is wp os due the high security in the os itself which is very good but some time we need to allow some apps to do extra works apps which we trust ie hotmail app facebook app skype app
1309_1	1	a	it will be a good idea if you introduce a trust center or maybe trusted apps which requires more review form microsoft before publishing maybe
1309_2	0	a	the idea is that we can develop a regular app and we request our permissions in the manifest or the app can ask for trust so if the user agrees the app will be shown in the trusted app center in the settings with its extra permissions requested
1309_3	0	a	as an example for the trusted app center settings myownemailclient app permission requested send email without user intervention send sms without user intervention manage contacts readwrite and so on
1309_4	0	a	facebook app manage contacts readwrite send sms
1314_1	0	a	navigation uri doesnt work if the reminderalarm ring under lockscreen
1314_2	0	a	its annoying having to download and install the toolkit separately
1315_1	0	a	how is it that there is no check all button for the list of email messages
1318_1	0	a	we have two pages the main tile page and then all apps
1319_3	0	a	included with biometric framework outofbox supply facial recognition module using front facing camera
1319_4	0	a	ability to block incoming calls sms text messages from specific phone numbers within a list configured by the user
1319_5	0	a	every app places the search control in different areas often hidden under a subsection of the app
1319_11	0	a	a new tile who is be a folder
1319_13	0	a	when you click this tile you open a folder with different apps
1319_14	0	a	and rebind of the serach button
1319_15	0	a	i am from russia and bing dont work here
1319_16	0	a	so when i click the search button i open the internet explorer
1324_2	0	a	i would like to register a url with my application so that when someone clicks in the browser or is redirected to the browser from another application they are given the option to open my application instead of the browser
1324_3	0	a	with default options etc
1325_1	0	a	this would be good in windows too
1325_2	0	a	the smilies are displayed as colon dash parentheses signs
1326_1	0	a	in windows mobile this library exist and its very good for retreive lot of cell tower informations cell id mnc mcc lac imei imsi lot of information we do not have access with windows phone
1327_1	0	a	the alarm and reminder classes in microsoftphonescheduler are very limiting and do not allow for any customization
1327_2	0	a	ideally these classes would be extended to accept a usercontrol object that would be shown instead of the standard title
1328_2	0	a	from there the application could be fully launched if desired
1328_4	0	a	when scrolling down list or opening item in list app catalog hangs
1328_5	0	a	i assume the catalog is hanging for a moment while loading data however there is no indicator and the result is a jerky experience
1330_1	0	a	it doesnt increase the wish to develope the product
1330_2	0	a	where can i vote for showing sales up to limit usd
1330_3	0	a	i currently have wp sdk installed and i am not able to get the emulator working consistently
1330_17	0	a	in phone setting missing direct commands for enabledisableverify
1330_18	0	a	it is physically impossible for me to play my game in the emulator and capture an image of it that actually represents what gameplay looks like
1330_19	0	a	my game is controlled by the accelerometer and has very rapid gameplay that makes switching from using the accelerometer to screenshot tab and actually capturing a screenshot impossible
1330_20	0	a	it simply doesnt work
1330_21	0	a	in order to take the screenshot it takes mouse clicks and about half a second
1330_22	0	a	if i am lucky i can do it before my character dies even then though the player is just moving in a straight line to nowhere by the time i actually take the screenshot
1330_23	0	a	as such i cant capture the gameplay occurring in my game
1333_1	0	a	in window mobile open an endroid market
1334_1	0	a	i think microsoft provide azure cloud computing free for developer
1334_2	0	a	no need to feel up credit card details
1336_1	0	a	this just helps make advertising easier without listing individual apps
1336_3	0	a	for details and a workaround thats not working as smooth as it is when it was implemented in the control itself
1337_1	0	a	on android there is a great app that lets you backup your sms messages
1344_1	1	a	therefore it would be great if devs could put apps in the marketplace offering two more
1348_3	0	a	there are heaps and heaps of really good developers outside of us who really want to contribute to making windows phone a preferred choice so please microsoft make more
1351_1	0	a	step to reproduce
1352_1	0	a	type multiple number with semi colon separated for example
1352_2	0	a	copy this text and paste it to the to box in the new message expected actual
1353_1	0	a	entend network framework to allow developers to use ping and tracert like network utilities when developing enterprise applications on windows phone
1353_2	0	a	windows phone is inclined more towards individual user experience
1353_11	0	a	hi microsoft i would like to report a bug certain html code that causes the inbox to crash instantly upon viewing the email
1353_12	0	a	im not sure if this can be abused as weve seen on mango where the phone is non responsive upon receiving a specially crafted text via notification
1354_1	1	a	please leave your email so i can sent you the information
1355_1	0	a	i do not wish to leave it out there
1355_2	0	a	im searching for a way to send an sms to a smsservice number end then handle the received sms with reply information to the sent sms
1355_3	0	a	all to automate a smssrvice
1355_4	0	a	from what ive found i need to use smscomposetask mysms new smscomposetask mysmsbody thesmstextcodemsg some code to ask for information from the sms service mysmsto thesmsservicenumber mysmsshow and then the user have to confirm the sms sending no way to send automaticly from the app
1356_1	0	a	then the sms service sends a response
1356_3	0	a	is it possible
1357_1	0	a	and i want to get that response to my app to hanle it more
1357_3	0	a	for example i needed to rebrand one of my apps and while it appears under its new name in marketplace i cant change it to the new name in app hub
1358_1	0	a	as a recent purchaser of a windows phone i love the platform and it has huge potential to grow in competition with android and apple
1358_2	0	a	i am concerned however that microsoft are not pushing enough for access to successful top selling apps which are popular on the iphone and android platforms eg
1358_3	0	a	instagram
1358_4	0	a	if windows phones are to compete they have to acknowledge the big selling apps or they risk losing market share rather than gaining it
1358_7	0	a	im developing an app containing data that a user might want to keep in view for a while without worrying about accidentally pressing any of the hardware buttons thereby exiting the current view
1358_8	1	a	it would be great if i could display an option to lock the screen which would basically lock the screen but show my own page as the lock screen
1358_9	0	a	maybe the normal screen timeout would apply here as well rather than the lock screen timeout
1358_10	0	a	if the screen turned off pressing the unlock button would again display my page maybe with a builtin label at the bottom instructing the user to slide to unlock
1358_11	0	a	if the screen turned off pressing the unlock button would again display my page maybe with a builtin label at the bottom more
1358_12	0	a	on the windows phone website my account shows all the apps i downloaded but after resetting my phone i was forced to remember which ones were useful vs useless
1358_14	0	a	selectionchanged is the best handler for this use and it behaved as it should
1359_1	0	a	using mouseleftbuttonup will randomly activate when dragging and lifting your finger which is an unwanted result for a menu
1359_2	0	a	not really sure where to put this so i am going to ask here
1359_3	0	a	i really really loved the now playing screen on the zune hd like the current zune software with information and stuff moving over the artist background which panned
1359_4	0	a	is there any way microsoft could integrate this into the next version of windows phone
1359_5	0	a	it was a great idea and i am sad to see it go with the zune hd and not move over to windows phone
1359_7	0	a	when we are on call and the same time i want to look up for a number from phone book i cant do it right now
1360_1	0	a	ill have ro out the other caller on hold to get a number
1360_2	1	a	adding this feature will help alot
1361_1	0	a	at the moment theres no way for an app to know if its primary live tile is visible or not
1361_3	0	a	although the native screenshot feature is reported to not be available until windows phone i have some concerns regarding this feature that may impact windows phone apps as well
1361_4	0	a	since this issue will impact my decisions when developing my windows phone app i do not consider this off topic
1361_5	0	a	i am concerned whether we will be able to opt out or disable the feature within our apps
1361_6	0	a	i am concerned about security and drm issues
1361_7	0	a	will microsoft provide an api that will allow us to
1361_9	0	a	programmatically enable or disable the feature in various areas of the app
1361_11	0	a	if so what happens to existing windows phone apps that run on a windows phone device
1361_12	0	a	will screen shots work by default for windows phone apps
1361_13	0	a	if so and there is no api to restrict usage for existing windows phone app but there will be an api to restrict functionality for windows phone app i may want to wait for windows phone before deploying my app
1361_14	0	a	programmatically enable or disable the feature more
1362_1	0	a	so that we can trigger our application on such events
1363_1	0	a	at the moment developers do not have any control on such tasks
1363_2	0	a	and its very frustrating to see other platforms like android and blackberry developers can easily do it
1364_1	0	a	so that i can manage the phone send messages manage apps account settings and so on
1364_2	0	a	all this by using the bigger and faster interface of the computer
1365_1	0	a	i do really like the idea of contract in windows
1366_1	0	a	will this feature included in wp
1366_3	0	a	application should run in background
1366_4	0	a	originally posted by sergiy russian characters in email subject field are replaced by question marks when reply is sent
1366_5	0	a	steps to reproduce send an email from gmail web interface with word as subject download the email using phone default client the subject is shown correctly press reply subject is still correct send the email check sent folder subject is displayed as
1366_6	0	a	check email in gmail subject is brolen as well ps
1366_7	0	a	the phone language and settings are uk english
1366_8	0	a	russian is used only as additional keyboard layout the bug mentioned above got a lot worse since last wp update if you reproduce steps you will get a message with actually broken email headers
1366_9	0	a	this is really frustrating considering that this bug was there for more than months
1367_1	0	a	also similar bug was spotted in native twitter client then uploading a picture to pictwittercom original tweet is displayed as
1367_2	0	a	instead of nonenglish characters
1367_3	0	a	russian is used only as additional keyboard more
1367_4	0	a	apps written for wp will not work on wp
1367_5	0	a	ok fine
1367_6	0	a	however in order to be able to support both platforms we are going to want some extensions on the wp side in order to support wp features that are not available on the older platform
1376_1	0	a	marketplaceapphub app hubmarketplace
1377_1	0	a	moreover recently geotrust claimed us to cancel us registration current one and reregister as russia
1378_1	0	a	indeed were discouraged and not happy
1378_2	0	a	there is no default property or method of listbox control which will give us the currently binded items on view or carousel control for wp
1380_1	0	a	bingmapsdirectionstask only set start point when the task is running its prompt getting directions its alert end point not found we couldnt find a match for your ending point
1380_2	0	a	i dont think this is a good design for bingmapsdirectionstask its not flexible
1380_3	0	a	i cloud be only set the start point or not
1380_4	0	a	currently we have to download and configure the silverlight toolkit to get certain ui elements that should really be integrated with the platform
1380_5	1	a	please add these to the platform
1380_6	0	a	there is lack of support for digitally signing x client certificates
1380_7	0	a	also there is no support for storing certificates in certificate store using net code and located in the device
1380_8	0	a	facilidade para definir qualquer mp como toque e transferncia de arquivos sem a necessidade do zune pois ridculo ter de utilizar um programa ruim sem poder definir as coisas da maneira que eu quero
1380_9	0	a	machine translation up the phone more tramp in the market if you can set music as ringtone alarms etc as in windows i have to create ringtone facility to define any mp as a ringtone and transfer of files without the need of zune it is ridiculous to have to use a bad program without being able to set things up the way i want
1380_10	0	a	open the damn thing up
1380_11	0	a	less than market share and the platform is more locked up than my wifes vagina
1380_12	0	a	had a great idea for an app and after seconds of research i found it was impossible to do with wp
1380_13	0	a	there does not seem to be a way to control newlines in the application descriptions on the marketplace
1382_3	0	a	i would jump at the opportunity to adapt my apps for windows phone if microsoft more
1383_3	0	a	one public folder with full access as flash memory with configurable size
1383_4	0	a	that folder would be available for all apps
1383_11	0	a	currently i know of developers creating deep link tiles from xaml in their application so the idea isnt too far off
1383_12	0	a	this came up while talking to other developers at a few talksmeetups not because i created the largest vector based creative commons icon pack for windows phone that many of you use already
1384_1	0	a	currently i know of developers creating more
1385_1	0	a	in short now that we can have multiple tiles sure its great that they can open the app
1385_2	0	a	but why not let us flip the tile instead note the mail tile would always open the app
1385_3	0	a	think of a stocks app where you see the price and change on the front then tapping it shows the graph on the back
1386_1	0	a	perhaps a doubletap opens the app like they do now
1387_1	0	a	social networking apis like facebook are constantly adding new features
1387_2	0	a	proving access to the authentication directly even if it were temporary would allow applications to use the most uptodate social networking sdk to provide better features for their users
1387_3	1	a	a grantaccountaccesstask could for example ask the user for temporary access including what permissions are needed
1389_1	0	a	if the user did not have an account configured for that provider they could be given the chance to create one or simply redirected to the social network providers website
1395_2	0	a	i like to keep my start screen tidy with relatively few apps but the alphabetized list is cumbersome when i forget the name of an app
1396_1	0	a	lets keep the automatic adjustment of screen brightness with manual compensation that increases or decreases the value automatically set
1399_2	0	a	i know that storage and storing information is limited to the application context
1400_1	0	a	im android developer ive been through interoperability guide and read about this
1400_2	0	a	ive been wondering if something can be done through the silverlight but all that failed since read that
1400_3	0	a	cheers
1400_4	0	a	on all the buttom right where i can share etc i would like to be able to print
1400_5	0	a	it needs to be and integrated part of the phones functionality that is why i put it in framework
1400_6	0	a	no appdriven solution
1400_7	0	a	having a lot of igear iphone ipads etc that can print it is dissappointing not beeing able to use the equipment i already own
1402_1	0	a	im sure a lot of potential customers have the same contemplations but decides to stay on ios instead of switching
1404_3	0	a	can you not make connection to these more
1406_2	0	a	de una buena vez quiten la interfaz metro se ve bien desde una app de escritorio pero en el mvil es horrible
1407_3	0	a	this is experienced on a nokia lumia os version
1407_5	0	a	for instance normally a stock price tile updates every minutes via a background task but if you tap it the quote updates instantly
1407_6	0	a	or perhaps you have a tile that shows you where you arerestarurant or whereverand you simply tap it to check in there
1407_7	0	a	no need to open the app
1407_8	0	a	since its userinitiated it wouldnt drain the battery
1415_2	0	a	i found a problem with displaying html in the builtin browser ie windows phone

1416_1	0	a	i would like to develop a bedside alarm clock app where the user can control the brightness by touch so the app can run with the screen off unless the user is touching the screen or the user can pinch to make the display lighter or darker
1416_2	0	a	all i am able to control at the moment is the contrast of the display by playing with the colours and alpha levels of the rendered graphics
1416_3	0	a	silverlight for windowsphone provides basic builtin binding validation through the bindingvalidatesonexceptions property as documented in the silverlight data binding topic
1416_4	0	a	however the phone versions of the controls do not provide validation templates
1417_1	0	a	to support validation one option is to retemplate the controls to provide your own validation template
1417_2	0	a	for example you can customize the desktop version of the template provided in the textbox styles and templates topic
1419_1	0	a	weve heard a lot about the default experiences in the phone especially the different hubs are a great resources for developers and designers to get a feel for some real world implementations of the metro design language and get inspired from them

1450_3	0	a	we have the photochoosertask which works great and does the job but we do not have access to music on the device
1451_1	0	a	the reason i think this should be allowed is because there are many artists who make their own music that are new and put their music on the device
1451_3	0	a	what do you people think do you hear where i am coming from with this idea

1459_5	0	a	using the google app i find some nearby but i guess the google app doesnt have my exact location
1460_1	0	a	well from ie you can also search
1460_2	0	a	but let us say i visited the bicycle page from google and want to search forsunglasses to buy when i go to town anywaythe search in ie is yet again the bing thing
1460_3	0	a	get it i do not want bing
1460_4	0	a	as long as it cant give me relevant search results keep the darn thing away from my phone
1460_5	0	a	i would like and recommend the phone to others but this is just too big an issue to overlook
1461_1	0	a	im sure fixing the phone is easiest fastest and cheapest
1461_3	0	a	but let more
1462_1	0	a	i started writing an application that was going to send text to all my friends who are on messenger and so i thought i may have access to that over the phone since i can now chat via messenger
1462_2	0	a	unfortunately that task or access does not exist
1462_3	0	a	is that in the upcoming roadmap

1464_1	0	a	theres no way to specifically highlight the paticular place that were wanting to show to the user
1466_1	0	a	even half way round the world from where we wanted to show
1466_2	0	a	it is possible to perform a search for the latitude and longitude of the place but this results in a pin that displays the latitude and longitude which can be confusing
1468_1	0	a	or if the search finds more
1469_2	0	a	internet explorer keeps running in background and is always visible while back button is kept pressed
1469_3	0	a	that is good for multitasking and it resumes the work from where we left but still if i have done using it i cant close it down
1469_4	0	a	that is irritating actually
1470_3	0	a	would work just like apple does there is no reason why we need to purchase a certificate every year from a root ca and worry about certificate chain issues
1472_3	0	a	many small developers skip brazil and korea from worldwide distribution because there are mandatory rating agency requirements
1473_2	0	a	in the start screen
1474_1	0	a	the current developer ecosystem for windowsphone apps is focused on individual developers or corporate developer accounts that typically distribute apps to the masses via the marketplace
1475_1	0	a	internal use of apps is defined as a beta test and requires a list of live ids designated to allow a certain set of users to download and use the app
1476_1	0	a	this is very limited and also time consuming
1476_2	0	a	ideally a company may wish to dedicate a group of live ids as testers to be used each time
1478_1	0	a	for this cost a company would receive two unlocked windowsphone devices that could be traded or upgraded
1478_2	0	a	this allows a team to use these devices for testing as opposed to having to put company apps on their personal devices or hand their devices over for demonstrations
1478_3	0	a	the enterprise account would also allow for distribution of apps at the organizational level either inhouse or to clients
1479_1	0	a	the targeted distribution approach doesnt seem to satisfy the need to sell or distribute from a company to clients
1479_3	0	a	it could also allow for a specific download key if purchases were made outside of the app marketplace
1479_4	0	a	together this level of support would cater to a market that would like to leverage the marketplace in a unique way while having the tools and capabilities to develop apps without requirements of personal accounts or devices
1479_8	0	a	this would enable apps like skype to work in background and show incoming call nobtification

1486_1	0	a	its very usefull when you want to make application with for example voice or image processing
1487_1	0	a	it is not possible to select the port to receive messages
1487_2	0	a	before receiving an udp message a message has to be send using sockets

1488_2	0	a	there is no possibility to choose a specific port number
1488_3	0	a	sending an udp broadcast send to is not supported
1488_4	0	a	upnp and udp multicast is more
1488_5	0	a	there all still to much bugs on current main apps
1488_6	0	a	like on twitter sometimes we cant follow during viewing a profile
1488_8	0	a	the mediaplayer class can play song objects but there is currently no way to get at the song data
1488_9	1	a	allow binary access would allow custom vizualizations media players and audio enabled games
1488_10	0	a	this would also solve another requested issue where devs want to get visualization data
1488_11	0	a	with access to the song binary this data could just be created by the dev
1489_1	0	a	a media picker control that you could activate that would let the user go through their media library and check off a list of songs or videos
1489_2	1	a	this would also be very nice so that you could add a create playlist feature into the musicvideo hub

1500_1	0	a	can this be possible on the phone
1500_2	0	a	it will allow code anywhere anytime on windows idea
1500_3	0	a	when you create a tile dynamically it is common to want to save it as a png file so that it uses transparency so that it respects the theme accent color
1500_4	0	a	however there is no built in method to save a writeablebitmap as a png
1500_5	0	a	there is however a nice extension to save it to jpg but that doesnt help if you want to use transparency to leverage the theme accent color in your tile
1500_6	0	a	i think many apps that need to generate a tile dynamically will encounter this issue

1500_10	0	a	for instance if i build a childrens book app and then submit that same app times each time with a different name and book loaded i have essentially used up all the available space on the marketplace app search results screen thereby stifling competition and innovation through use of questionable practices and a bad app design
1502_1	0	a	all subsequent childrens book apps will be essentially undiscoverable no matter how good they are start by expanding the number of apps that can use a certain key word such as childrens stories so that new apps who innovate can displace those who got their first with potentially crappy apps

1504_3	0	a	i am using a open source api called openstack storage that requires passing empty headers to remove certain custom metadata entries
1505_1	0	a	the library being used by wp httpwebrequest doesnt allow passing empty headers
1505_2	0	a	it is unacceptable simply because according to rfc section header field definitions the message headers of an http message value is optional
1505_3	0	a	this is limiting me to provide customers to fully use my app for stuff like removing entries on their objects
1505_4	0	a	the error i receive is something like the header xxxxx has an empty value

1507_4	0	a	windows phone breaks from ios and android by removing the need to open an app to share pictures and statuses by adding a sharing api
1507_5	1	a	however this must be updated by microsoft
1507_7	0	a	these services would be in charge of running the api and posting the data and could take the form of an implementable interface such as a ilinksharer or something similar allowing the windows phone sharing interface to constantly expand and become dynamic tailored to the users needs while removing the requirement for microsoft to make the updates as the zune attempted to do with its apps a bad idea

1515_7	0	a	as app developers we are currently stuck with methods of generating revenues one time app payment ads
1515_9	0	a	this would mean we could make ad free apps that developers are motivated to keep adding features to over time since they are generating ongoing revenues
1515_11	0	a	lets say you have a library a that the developer strongly signed

1515_14	0	a	in the net full framework we would use a config file to make assembly binding redirection normally we would point all versions of a to its most recent version but this is not possible right now in windows phone as far as i can now this affects the whole silverlight framework not just windows phone we really need assembly binding redirection or publisher policies is windows phone

1557_1	0	a	in trying to develop a custom playlist application it is apparent that it is impossible to integrate the backgroudaudioplayer with the xnamedialibrary
1557_2	0	a	this means that applications that wish to use the capabilities of the backgroundagent are restricted to using only local audio files that are deployed with teh application or audio streaming sources
1558_1	0	a	there is no way to access the phones medialibraysongs to have the bap play these files in teh background
1558_2	0	a	this is highly restrictive because we can only use the mediaplayer for foreground applications
1558_3	0	a	unless of course we go with a predetermined songcollection such as songcollection limitedplaylist new medialibrarysongs this stops the ability to create custom playlists
1558_4	0	a	there are really a number of ways ms could address this limitation
1558_6	0	a	this way we can pass the entire songcollection object to the mediaplayerplay method and providing we dont stop the mediaplayer the entire playlist will continue to play despite other foreground applications running
1558_10	0	a	so long as the user must explicitally accept the use of teh app in the background then why is it an issue
1558_11	0	a	users understand the additional strain this would potentially put on battery life but by accepting they agree that its okay
1558_12	0	a	these are only my suggestions there may be smarter ways to achieve this but in the end the current functionallity is pointless

1567_6	0	a	i can see two ways of accessing the barcode scan
1567_7	0	a	from the search button as it is right now user scans a bar code sees the output of the search where he can tap on the icon of the decoded barcode and could be given the choice of an application who can use such information
1567_8	0	a	the application would receive the decoded information and also information about the barcode as the type etc
1568_1	0	a	the other way would be to invoke the scanner from my application as for the web search
1570_1	0	a	user opens my application click a button visual search gets opened users scan a barcode clicks on the thumbnail result and is redirected to my application with information on the code
1570_2	0	a	is it a good idea
1571_1	0	a	thank you very much great phone
1571_2	0	a	hello thank you for this site

1588_1	0	a	from time to time our university also likes to submit applications which are in most of the cases not fully grown products but tech demos or prototypes
1589_1	0	a	however there is no category for publishing apps in such a category and most of the users react unintelligibly and give bad reviews as they expect a fully grown product

1692_4	1	a	let us open up the phone application here the the user can see callhistory
1693_1	1	a	also let us open the callhistory page both are usefull for smartdialing apps
1694_1	1	a	an app can at least have a button directly to call history so user can see call history since a direct api for callhistory is not given due to security reasons
1694_2	0	a	and a smart dialer can then be a full alternative to the builtin phone app since the app also can have a quickbutton for goto the regular phone app whenever the user wants to do that

1714_2	1	a	there should be a random id instead after every reset
1714_3	1	a	to become regionally recognized i believe windows phonedevices languages should be regionally supported
1714_4	0	a	ios
1715_1	0	a	windowsapp hub
1715_2	0	a	what oo
1715_3	0	a	every time a microphone recording on htc hd windows phone device is starting a slight sound of bump is added to the recording stream
1716_1	0	a	it is hard to hear since the sound of it is very low but if the raw pcm stream is enhanced with wav headers so that the sound is windowsplayable the bump turns out to be very noticeable
1716_2	0	a	the same code ran on an emulator does not results in this bump
1717_1	0	a	the problem appears on both xna and audiosink recording approaches
1717_2	0	a	in order to reproduce it one should just try to record an audio on the wp device not an emulator have its code add wav headers to the audio stream and save it to an isolated storage
1718_1	0	a	then copy it to a windows environment to play in media player
1718_2	0	a	at the beggining of an audio a bump is heard
1718_3	0	a	the problem may be relevant to htc hd only though since i have no other device to test
1718_4	0	a	in order to reproduce it one should just try to record an audio on the more
1718_5	0	a	even if mediaplayer does not contains copyrighted media phone recorded video it is not possible to capture its content
1718_6	0	a	when i buy a game and for any reasons i want to change my hd for a lumia for eg
1718_7	0	a	i will lost all my gamesi really be happy if i can download them from a virtual saving platform to my new deviceor for a technical problem i have to reboot my phonei would like to have those games back without download it again
1718_8	1	a	bing music search should add the ability to learn about the artist and to get the song lyrics for the song it hears
1718_9	1	a	recognition is very accurate it should be easy to add two buttons for this
1718_10	1	a	marketplace app needs predictive typing not just app matching as you type
1718_11	0	a	this would speed up searches
1718_13	0	a	microphoneisheadset property now always return true even without headset connected
1719_1	0	a	it seems like not a good behaviour
1719_2	1	a	this property should return correct information about connected headset
1719_3	0	a	enabledisable button for wake up on text message
1719_4	0	a	creation of the hub of the programs in the list of all programs to reduce the displayed number
1719_5	0	a	currently we only have the choice of hearing the voice notification in headset when the ringvibrate is selected which also ring the phone
1719_6	1	a	would be nice to have the same notification in the headset only when in vibrate only mode
1719_7	1	a	at least for air france i did not test it for other companies the picture send by sms are not compatible with wp it should be great to be able to open it
1719_8	1	a	weve got the worst supply of google apps we need these two to exist on this phone please please please add this we need it
1719_9	0	a	like the dashboard update twist control from the xbox
1719_10	0	a	first look at smoedjndeviantartcomartlumiaxbslide
1719_11	1	a	add a wishlist section to the marketplace so that users can keep track of apps they would like to buy but maybe cant afford right now or dont have space for at the moment etc
1719_12	0	a	in addition to trybuyinstall buttons on an apps marketplace listing add a pin to wishlist option
1719_13	0	a	asphalt for platform windows phone
1719_14	1	a	create app of video filters and advanced settings including different simulated noise film stock and lense
1720_1	0	a	name
1721_1	1	a	it would be good to backup linked contacts
1722_1	0	a	now when you reset your phone or move to a new phone the linking is not kept
1723_1	0	a	save linking with the live id
1724_1	0	a	i came from android world where i really liked the google map integration with turn by turn navigation
1726_1	0	a	where any address can be opened in google map then get direction and launch the navigation from the same screen
1727_1	0	a	in which it will pick up the address from the map and gets the turn by turn voice direction and it works like a charm
1728_1	1	a	i really liked the wp and would love to see similar fuctionality availlable in wp too
1728_2	1	a	the musicvideos app should have side selection boxes in every category like the ones used for selecting multiple messages in the email app making it easier to create playlists and play selected songsartistsalbumsgenresvideos
1728_3	1	a	i request we are able to have full customization capability
1728_4	0	a	just like windows
1728_5	0	a	the wp os is great
1728_6	0	a	but it lacks the capability to increase volume of the device or costomize live tiles or backround
1729_1	0	a	one thing the people want is to make there device there own
1730_1	1	a	ms should make an advenced config
1730_2	0	a	app that will allow to do all this to there live tiles backround and to the volume
1730_3	1	a	let us creat on our own devices
1731_1	0	a	we will be happy
1731_2	0	a	and ms will beat all the other plat forms
1732_1	1	a	would be nice to mirror phone screen to tv through xbox like ios ipadapple tv
1732_2	0	a	i noticed that on some windows phones the touch sensitive buttons vibrate and some dont
1733_1	0	a	and the focus s and flash you can change it
1733_2	0	a	i have a dell venue pro and the buttons dont vibrate
1734_1	1	a	all windows phones with touchsensitive buttons should vibrate
1734_2	0	a	when returning to an app using multitasking
1734_3	0	a	the ability to create multiple custom start views for pinning tiles to similar to android and ios
1735_1	0	a	for example one screen for work one for personal and perhaps one for entertainment
1735_2	0	a	could access these views via icons below the app listing arrow
1735_3	0	a	applicationbar buttonmenuitem text text click command commandparameter
1735_4	0	a	this is the feature i miss the most from android
1735_5	0	a	it makes getting around the city so much easier
1735_6	0	a	i just tell maps where i want to go and it will tell me what bus to take to get there
1735_7	0	a	it also knows the bus schedule so it will tell me when i need to be at a bus stop
1736_1	0	a	pcwebmarketplace pcjajp ms
1737_1	1	a	enable user apps to use the bluetooth hansfree notification just like when receiving a sms on while the phone is connected to a handsfree
1737_3	0	a	toast message seem to be localizable only serversided
1737_4	0	a	that has at least disadvantages more work to do for programmers always check if user has changed the language and notify the webservice so it can change toast messages if user changes language and dont start app there is no way of notifying the webservice that is has changed so user will get wrong language toasts change it to a localizable mechanism please
1737_5	0	a	for ebook etc
1737_6	0	a	according to the description the pushpin object should work as popup information window activated by pressing the map icon
1737_7	0	a	now it doesnt work the same way
1737_8	1	a	looks like its functionality should be corrected
1737_9	1	a	the emulator should include a treeview control to display a live view of page states app state isolatedstoragesettings isolatedstoragefiles the ideal would include some kind of object drill down in the style of mole for wpf but even tostrings would work
1737_10	0	a	this combined with file drag drop from windows explorer would make app life cycle debugging a lot simpler
1738_1	0	a	today when users click a link in ie most of the times you would get a message that this content type is not supported on phone
1739_1	0	a	altough there are app like office acrobet reader and many rd party apps which handles the particular contenttype
1740_1	1	a	we need to have a way by which applications can register the type of content they handle so that when user is downloading a content using ie they can choose installed application to open with
1740_2	0	a	today application are achieving this by embedding browser control which is not a good expereince for end user
1740_3	0	a	since the screen times out after option has the maximum time for only minute and as a consumer perspective its okay but for a developer this feature is very annoying when we debug our apps on the device and the visual studio shows the message like the application could not be launched for debugging
1741_1	1	a	ensure that the target device screen is unlocked and that the application is installed
1741_2	0	a	like other platforms are having the option for usb debugging
1741_3	0	a	the same could be implemented in the windows phone so that developer can use it hassle free
1741_4	0	a	a general use case is that i am working on an app and just started debugging the application on the device and suppose encountered an issue and now i stopped debugging and now i started to resolve that issue and mostly it takes the time in which the device get locked and again if i debug the app then the same error popups
1741_5	1	a	so please add a developer option and put the best options for the developers in that menu
1741_6	0	a	thanks since the screen times out after option has the maximum time for only minute and as a consumer perspective its okay but for a developer this feature is very annoying when we debug our apps on the device and the visual studio shows the message like the application could not be launched for debugging

1741_13	0	a	while listening to new music i want to be able to updatecorrect song metadata such as title genre album and rating
1742_1	0	a	thats rating not likedislike
1742_2	1	a	rating is an int variable and i want to be able to specify an exact value
1742_3	0	a	currently i can read this value but i cannot write to it so that it syncs and updates the library on my computer from where the song came from
1742_4	1	a	add the wp marketplace to xbox s so people can browse apps on their tv rather than just computer and phone
1743_1	0	a	would give windows phone more exposure especially when xbox users can see all the xbox live games for windows phone availiable
1744_1	0	a	the listbox and multiselectlist destroys and creates controls while scrolling up and down
1744_2	0	a	however when using a long list of checkboxes within one of those lists it randomly checks different checkboxes while scrolling
1744_3	0	a	info urls
1744_4	0	a	the ability to give a contact to another wp user is of value especially between me and my wife
1745_1	1	a	i pick up a contact we both know id like to be able to push it to her phone
1746_1	0	a	zunes could do it so why did the audible support get dropped before wp
1746_2	0	a	windows phone is an amazing media consumption device and bringing audiobooks back into the zune fold would make it that much better

1748_1	0	a	apisaveringtonetaskapioswindows phoneapi
1748_2	1	a	add api for access point configuration so server could send needed data via push notification and application would create new corporate wlan access point
1748_4	1	a	provide access to the podcast episodes that are in the media library so that they may be used to construct for instance custom playlists
1748_5	0	a	developers wishing to leverage the zune media platform to offer improved or tailored podcast playback experiences are currently blocked
1748_6	0	a	instead an app developer must reimplement all the podcast management functions that are already well handled by the device and the computer zune software
1749_1	0	a	once access to a users podcast subscriptions and already downloaded episodes is enabled developers may easily write applications which enhance the existing playback experience
1749_2	0	a	this idea could be relatively simply achieved as a new podcast genre however that would negatively impact those existing applications which are written with the expectation that all of a users genres are musical other than the ringtone genre
1749_3	0	a	a better implementation might expose a new property or method on medialibrary that provides access to a podcast subscription management and episode access object
1749_4	0	a	this idea could be relatively simply achieved as a more

1749_6	0	a	when you click on something in ie it overlays it with a gray box
1749_7	0	a	this looks especially bad with controls with rounded elements
1749_8	0	a	take a look at the jquery mobile demo on your wp to see what i mean
1749_9	0	a	this also applies to apps written using phonegap and so will stifle the burgeoning html app development
1749_10	1	a	please give us the means of turning this feature off
1749_11	0	a	thanks to colineberhardt for initially raising this issue
1749_12	0	a	iphoneandroidwebpctouchstartjavascriptie mobile webkit
1749_13	0	a	mango provides a good feature to scan an image for a text
1749_14	1	a	it would be great to provide a new launchertask which uses this new existing funtionality to get a string from an image
1750_1	0	a	otherwise we need to create our own control to scan an image and extract strings with an ocr library
1750_2	0	a	im not happy to implement something which is already there
1750_3	0	a	even if this api would use a webservice and needs network access i would be fine with that
1750_4	0	a	i have cribbs about the lack of file transfer over bluetooth but the inability to play video and game sounds through a bluetooth headset is very very lame
1751_1	0	a	i get to play music etc with by bluetooth headset
1752_1	0	a	the moment i open a video the sounds played back using the devices back speakers
1752_2	0	a	please note yalla apps in dubai provides way to submit apps to marketplace but it is too costly for developers which takes commission from total income of developers and provides only one device unlock for free
1752_3	0	a	also service is too slow
1753_1	0	a	you are running an application that records your gps position after traveling so many feet
1753_2	0	a	if for some reason your application gets deactivated you receive a phone call your recorded track will be missing data for the time you were on the phone
1754_1	0	a	this can be a serious problem if you need to follow the track back out
1754_2	0	a	what this forces the user to do is carry a handheld gps as well as a phone when the track log is important
1755_1	0	a	microsoftxnaframeworkmediamediaplayerqueueactivesong populates the artist property for music streamed from zune but not the name property so devs cant know what song is playing
1756_1	0	a	marketplace policy requires music apps to populate both properties so zune should do this too
1757_1	0	a	ability to create scheduled tasks that occur at a given interval
1757_2	0	a	regardless of the state of the phone
1759_1	0	a	ie like windows scheduled tasks or linux cron jobs
1759_2	1	a	i would like to schedule a job to post a url every min to keep alive untangle authentication

1760_6	1	a	the general concept of a resourceintensivetask being launched when constraints are met is strong but the implementation could be greatly improved
1760_7	0	a	some rits resource intensive tasks do not require comms and it is absurd to wait for connection to wifi prior to running them
1760_8	0	a	some rits that are comms intensive might use the mobile carrier anyway at user discretion
1760_9	0	a	some power hungry tasks are high priority and should run as soon as external power is available not wait an hour while the battery charges to
1760_10	0	a	some tasks need to run frequently for very short periods
1760_11	0	a	for example logging gps position for a tracking application with vehicle power supplied to the phone would run for sec every sec with another background task running every min for perhaps sec to send the batched data to a webservice
1760_12	0	a	for example logging gps more
1760_13	0	a	ssdp used in upnp relies on udp multicast for discovery
1760_14	0	a	currently udpanysourcemulticastclient allows for the listening to existing ssdp traffic as well as sending a solicitation msearch out requesting that upnp devices advertise themselves to the solicitor
1761_1	0	a	when a device replies to the msearch message it sends a unicast message to the ip port that the msearch message was sent from
1761_2	0	a	there is no way for a wp application using udpanysourcemulticastclient or socket to listen on the correct port thus requiring a great deal of time to be spent in any upnp application when doing device discovery
1761_3	1	a	proper socket support a fixed udpanysourcemulticastclient implementation or an explicit ssdp client which supports sending handling replies to msearch messages should be enabled
1761_4	0	a	proper socket more
1761_5	1	a	please provide an api that provides access to the texts to allow developers to implement an application to enable scenarios such as reading or archiving sms messages

1762_5	0	a	smime email is a mandatory requirement at my company and support for that on the windows phone platform is needed before we can consider it
1763_1	0	a	ime
1763_2	0	a	local database support would be much more useful with the addition of fulltext search support for quickly querying large amounts of text eg
1764_1	0	a	dictionaries
1764_2	0	a	other implementations of sql ce already support fulltext indexes ie
1764_3	0	a	through freetext and rival platforms such as android and ios can exploit sqlites fulltext support so wp is currently at a disadvantage
1764_4	0	a	wavapi
1764_5	1	a	easy access to the bing music api would be really useful especially for apps with artistsong recognition
1765_1	1	a	microsoft already allow developers to use the bing maps api in their api so i realy hope they consider opening up the bing apis for the coming tangoapollo dev toolsets
1765_2	1	a	would be nice to have a callback on for example the phonecalltask so that we can determine wether or not the user actually did press call or cancel
1766_1	0	a	same for other tasks and launchers
1767_1	1	a	it would be very nice to be able to download the entire windows phone tools and install it instead of having to use the web for installation
1767_2	0	a	i am a teacher and having to install it this way for the entire lab takes forever
1767_3	0	a	a event that triggers after a call has ended with phone nr and call length also giving an opportunity to display an app screen

1769_2	0	a	the encrypted dabase file generated by wpdt cant be open with vs or sql server hope you can fix this
1769_3	0	a	its funny how zune has the ability to sort pictures by name but when they get synced to a windows phone it loses that ability
1769_4	1	a	i really want this features because its useful in many ways
1769_5	0	a	would like to make a dialer application that would call through a list of numbers through the web notate what happened on the call keyboard or buttons then automatically launch next call
1769_6	0	a	this workflow sucks right now to have to confirm dialing each number
1769_7	1	a	make a new setting that allows users to optin to this functionality
1769_8	0	a	when watching videos i dont get audio through my bluetooth headphones but i do when just listening to audio
1769_9	0	a	since microsoft havent introduced a native c sdk for wp please create a computer emulator in c for wp
1769_10	0	a	like qemu in windows mobile
1769_11	1	a	the managed sdk should add support for using ssl client certificates for ssl mutualauthentication in httpwebrequest andor web service proxy classes

1771_1	0	a	and yes ive tried different headphones and even different phones to test my operator connection quality
1772_1	0	a	on android and iphone its fine i am even take some volume down on android as its too loud

1778_2	1	a	please fix this otherwise my and some other appsfunctions are not usable anymore see
1778_3	1	a	the idea is simple open a marketplace for developers only where devs can submit applications developed with an extended api which allows to access to more informationcapabilities on the device
1779_1	0	a	for instance texts contacts readwrite sockets in listening real multitasking etc we know that you released a superrestricted api to avoid developing apps that could give inexpert users troubles

1779_17	0	a	it is just not possible to do this at the moment
1781_1	0	a	other platforms ios and android do support this

1782_2	1	a	dont define restrictions for developers
1782_3	0	a	texture coordinate transforms are not exposed for any effects that can be used by the reach profile even though this is something the gpu can probably do cheaply
1782_4	0	a	a developer should be able to grant access to another app for data access

1783_3	1	a	when in card view it would be great to be able to close the running application either by swiping it away using a cross to close it or whatever means as having to enter one application and pressing the back button is time consuming and sometimes annoying
1784_1	1	a	i would like to see the metadata be part of the project in vs
1784_2	0	a	this would allow as others have suggested a more streamlined process for tracking changes and perhaps even uploading a single package without having to fill in the blanks
1784_3	1	a	an editor like propertiessettings would be great
1784_4	1	a	sharelinktask and sharestatustask should report error or information if the user doesnt have a social network
1784_5	1	a	launchers should have a callback that returns a string error message
1784_6	0	a	if the launcher isnt possible a property would be useful for disablingenabling buttons that start the launchers
1784_7	1	a	would like to see an improvement in mappolyline that allows multiple individual segments that have there own properties ie
1784_8	1	a	for example once you add a location to mappolyline instance that becomes a segment i should then be able to control the look and feed such as color of the stroke for that segment of the mappolyline
1784_9	0	a	currently changing the stroke changes the color for the entire line regardless of how many locations are added to the line
1784_10	1	a	also would like the ability to make the line a d gradient shape to have it pop out more on the map control
1784_11	1	a	i wish i could select connection speed for debugging in the emulator
1784_12	0	a	the android emulator can it
1784_13	0	a	theres one area where mango is a retrograde step when compared with nodo theme support
1784_14	0	a	in nodo the user could leave the app switch the theme ie
1784_15	0	a	dark or light return to the app which would now in theory respect their selection
1784_16	0	a	in mango the users faced with an unholy mess because the app is only informed of the systems theme state at startup
1784_17	0	a	developers have the choice of looking incompetent or ruthlessly picking a theme sticking to it thus rendering the ability to choose an overall theme pointless
1784_18	0	a	the smscomposetask does not provide any events
1784_19	1	a	i think we need completed event and something like smsresult that can be used
1784_20	0	a	currently some tasks exhibit this behaviour and some do not
1786_1	1	a	please make it a standard mode of usage for each task
1786_2	0	a	the amount of spam applications apps that are split out into several regions ie
1787_1	0	a	mytranspo series the ridiculous feed readers for all different musicians and whatnot single book applications and donothing apps ie
1788_1	0	a	the stuff published by ericrulz
1789_1	0	a	this is just absolutely ridiculous
1789_2	0	a	you already promised to take care of this but it didnt work
1789_3	0	a	weve still useless applications flooding the marketplace and there are no signs of it slowing
1790_1	1	a	i believe that instead of limiting the amount of certifications per user per day the marketplace should be a little better curated
1790_2	1	a	spam applications should not be approved
1791_1	1	a	they should never pass certification and should never be published
1792_1	1	a	bulk publishers should be made to consolidate their apps and the rest should not pass
1793_1	0	a	they should more
1793_2	0	a	i thought i had raised this as a platform request but seems its showing up in feature feedback instead
1794_1	0	a	multiline text input in the current version of the platform is usable if you can work out how or be told how to do it however its not very intuitive and i am concerned for apps that have this as a substantial feature the experience for consumers is not what it could be
1796_1	0	a	current capability for multiline navigation via textbox the way it currently works is if you tap and hold you get the i cursor to appear
1797_1	0	a	if you entered long lines of text that take up the width of the textbox then you will likely instinctively find you can scroll up and down through the text by dragging the cursor above and below the textbox
1797_2	0	a	however if you entered shorter lines you will find that this dragging action does not work until such time as the i cursor makes contact with some text
1798_1	0	a	you will see it visually lock in to the text when this happens
1798_2	0	a	i believe this will confuse users and create unecessary friction for consumers to make use of apps that depend on multiline input that potentially is longer than displayed in half allowing for the sip a portrait or landscape screen
1798_3	0	a	what would improve usability
1798_4	0	a	swipe gesture to control vertical scrolling when vertical scrollbar is autovisible latter is currently ignored
1798_5	1	a	if using taphold allow vertical scrolling without locking into text as described above
1798_6	0	a	alternatively to provide an experience consistent with the platforms sms text input capability provide support to allow textbox to grow as new lines are added
1798_7	0	a	be placed in a scrollviewer and have the viewport follow newlines as they are added
1798_8	0	a	thanks for considering
1799_1	0	a	link to related app hub suggestion link to related connect issue i thought i had raised this as a platform request but seems its showing up in feature feedback instead
1799_2	0	a	if you entered more
1799_3	1	a	when playing a video from an html video tag the player should allow the user to drag the progress bar to seek ahead in the video
1799_4	1	a	i would like to write business applications that get started when the phone is turned on and have as much control as a running app an idea would be having the phone snap pictures periodically and then uploading them
1799_5	0	a	there is currently no way to know if an emailcomposetask was cancelled or got an error while sending
1800_1	1	a	i need to be able to tell if the user actually went through with the email to know whether to delete the email text
1800_2	0	a	otherwise i have to ask the user if they sent it poor user experience
1800_3	1	a	for those of us wanting to provide free applications it would be nice if the wp supported self signed certs or the very least a widely known free ssl authority
1800_4	1	a	add servicepointmanager
1800_5	1	a	or at the very least add a free service to your accepted list of ssl authorities
1800_6	0	a	like cacertorg for instance
1800_7	1	a	i would like to see an agent like the scheduled task one that can be executed on a specific date and time
1800_8	0	a	it should be able to recur but to save battery it could be limited to daily
1800_9	0	a	think of an app that needs to update the tile once a year or month to remind the user of something
1800_10	0	a	currently this is not possible because the agents are disabled after days if the application is not opened
1801_1	0	a	appspecific launchers instead of opening a sites web page check whether a compatible app is installed or registered
1802_1	0	a	ux is much better and
1803_1	0	a	to support things like midroll video advertisments multiple mediaelements are needed
1804_1	0	a	this is supported in silverlight for the web
1805_1	0	a	it would be helpfull to have a passwordbox like control which supports number only keyboard
1805_2	0	a	numeric only passwords makes more sense for smartphone world as its fast convenient and easy to type
1805_3	0	a	privatecorporate wifi authentication with a certificate is not supported at mango
1806_1	0	a	this could allow for quite a few scenarios someone is currently locked in with a carrier that doesnt have wp phones available
1806_2	0	a	they could actually purchase apps on the marketplace and use them
1806_3	0	a	enable a codeonce and runs on windows or phone
1808_1	1	a	it would be good to have a video chooser task that works in the same way as the photochoosertask
1809_1	0	a	the reason for this is for users to be able to do things like apply filters add audio tracks crop out a relevant section etc of a recorded video and saving it back to the medialibrary
1809_2	0	a	i assume saving to the medialibrary will be part of the ar functionality in mango anyway
1809_3	0	a	this will benefit for applications which create audio or recording voice it will be easy and unified way to export audio files instead of create extra server program
1809_4	1	a	cursor arrow keys are needed on the virtual keyboard
1809_5	0	a	using touch to position the cursor is a good start but its clumsy and easily off by one character which would be acceptable if there were at least a left arrow key in addition to backspace
1809_6	0	a	perhaps at least presshold on backspace to bring up an arrows menu
1809_7	0	a	besides myself is there any interest in adding this capability
1809_8	0	a	i request that the multiscaleimage library to be able to access isolated storage
1809_9	0	a	there are many places where apps will not connect to a cell tower eg
1809_10	0	a	in a general aviation or commercial aircraft where cell phones do not work well it is illegal to use in any case and also in isolated rural areas
1809_11	0	a	also why pay data charges to view the same image over and over arent music photo libraries stored on phones
1809_12	0	a	and finally memory is very cheap
1809_13	0	a	some suggest that large images even broken into tiles are inappropriate for storage on a phone that is ridiculous
1809_14	0	a	if a user wants an application to host content whether it be gb of music or gb of image tiles for a needed application that should be their prerogative
1809_15	1	a	local multiscaleimage functionality is available on iphone so please do not put wp developers at a disadvantage
1809_16	0	a	if a user wants to pan around a large image what difference does it make to the form factor whether it is local or online none
1809_17	1	a	please get this component opened up for isolated storage use in the near future
1809_18	0	a	some suggest that large images even broken into tiles are inappropriate for storage on a phone that more
1809_19	0	a	the implementation of the sql compact was a pretty steap learning curve for me as i was used to the net gui implementation that made it very easy to use
1809_20	1	a	i think there needs to be more focus on making it easier and quicker to implement these plumbing features as a lot of developers will be hobbyist and do not contain the time and knowledge required to implement of lot of these plumbing features
1809_21	1	a	please make it quick and simple for us to get our ideas out there
1809_22	1	a	detailed customization should be an after thought for us
1809_23	1	a	allow apps with the interop capabilty flag in the manifest perhaps via custom certificate like microsoft office digital certificate for vba projects
1810_1	0	a	these are valid only on the device on which they were created so the only phone youd brick would be your devunlocked own
1810_2	1	a	ok i realize that this is dependent on the carrier but wp needs to support it if the carrier can offer it
1810_3	0	a	somebody correct me if i am way off base
1814_1	0	a	please let me know how to do this
1815_1	0	a	both on my ios and droid i can use my work email exchange server
1815_2	0	a	however the webbased certificate is not signed by a trusted member and was always allowed to okay it with those oses
1815_3	0	a	wp will only let me use exchange with registered and installed certificates and will not let me bypass if i know it is okay
1815_4	0	a	ability to display street side and birds eye view from bing map control
1815_5	0	a	when you update an app and update the app tile icon andor background image save the update as it is not working
1815_6	1	a	allow one application to launch another application with a url
1815_7	1	a	the launching application should be allowed to send information to the launched application via query strings
1815_8	0	a	imagine if you are calling someone who is already involved in a call the waiting notification displayed which has been available for long time in several mobiles could give you a relief to contact him later instead of doing a recurring calling and bothering himher
1815_9	0	a	this is a missing feature since windows mobile
1815_10	0	a	do you agree that it is time to have it now
1815_11	1	a	add a tile view like in old windows store
1815_12	0	a	it was great to see at a glance rating money generated by the application
1815_13	1	a	enable recording of fm radio
1815_14	0	a	currently in mango these is a soft search button in the gui displayed for context sensitive search
1815_15	0	a	the hardware button seems to always pull up a bing
1816_1	0	a	surely the design ideology was that the hardware search button was context sensitive
1817_1	1	a	if so then the soft search button is not needed and can be removed from being displayed if a hardware button is available
1817_2	0	a	this would free up more screen real estate especially as many application bars only have a soft search button on them anyway
1817_3	0	a	in order to display more details on network connection and to distinguish wifi networks connected to
1817_4	1	a	allow filtering of marketplace results within categories beyond payfreetopnew by adding filter by rating ex by price ex by number of downloads ex or allow blacklisting of developers or developer rankings so spam apps and spam devs could be avoided
1818_1	1	a	enable fm scan function in the developer api
1819_1	0	a	i notice it is already available to the user in the version mango but i dont see methods in the api for scanning to the next signal or seeking whatever the term is called
1819_2	1	a	allow apps to be hiddenvisible in the store without having to go through the whole update process
1820_1	0	a	back to how it was on the old dashboard would be ideal just a simple link to toggle between visible and hidden
1821_1	0	a	handy for if you have to take the back end server offline so new users cant download your app and instantly think the app is useless
1822_1	0	a	in the new store is not possible to delete an existing app from the storeor if exist it is really well hidden
1823_1	0	a	in addiction if you try delete an app name you can also confirm your operation but the name doesnt get deleted and stay reserved for the app
1823_2	0	a	i cant see the total downloads of my apps anymore because the downloads prior to the new dashboard has vanished
1824_1	0	a	currently we need to do some trickery to take screenshots of application that use panorama control
1824_2	0	a	we can access exif info limited using a picture object when dealing with media library
1824_3	0	a	but if we try to save an image within app inside media library or some isolated storage we cant prserve exif info of that image
1824_4	1	a	a better manipulation of exif apis will be very helpfull
1824_5	0	a	read the given link for more details
1824_6	0	a	when you use the defaultitem property of the panorama control its as if youre just rearranging the items
1824_7	0	a	i use this property to restore application state after tombstoning but the user experience is terrible because this just causes the pano items to reorder themselves
1824_8	0	a	the correct behavior would be if the panorama were to immediately scroll to the default page whether animated or not
1824_9	0	a	the old developer dashboard allowed me to remove apps that i no longer want to be published
1824_10	0	a	i cant do this in the new developer center for apps that have passed certification and are published in the store
1824_11	0	a	the keywords people use in unsuccessful marketplace searches particularly in the desktop zune application would if ranked by frequency provide useful information to developers on where to focus their development efforts
1824_12	0	a	this would create more opportunities for developers while also helping to provide customers with the apps they want
1824_13	0	a	needed to create pro level sequencers synths and music creation related apps
1824_14	0	a	if i want to update a live tile from my own app i cant draw its background image on the phone because if i store it to isolatedstorage i am not able to get an uri for it which i could provide the standardtiledataobject with
1824_15	0	a	if there were an extras menu option in ie where rd party apps could be plugged in it would be possible to pass perhaps the url of the currently selected site onto apps that could add value for instance by giving the option to subscribe to an rss or atom feed where present
1824_16	0	a	when developing with the phone connected via usb having the screen lock itself is very annoying and makes app deployment fail
1824_17	0	a	some wp phone not the att samsung focus have a never screen timeout
1824_18	0	a	however this is for battery and powered scenarios and you dont want to be manually switching it back and forth all the time
1824_19	0	a	some of us are stuck with a phone that locks itself all the time
1825_1	0	a	the screen lock also interrupts or prevents app deployment
1826_1	0	a	this makes visual studio fail to start the debugging session
1826_2	1	a	an app deployment should unlock the screen and reset the lock timer to zero
1827_1	0	a	an app deployment should unlock the screen and reset the more
1827_2	1	a	we need a beta store for windows apps for selected internal testers only
1828_1	0	a	with the windows phone store it was possible to have a beta version of the appwith windows apps it was not and nobody ever got why
1828_2	1	a	copy from android and add beta and alpha store too
1829_1	0	a	do not complain if developers prefer other platforms you dont make us life easy at all
1830_1	0	a	currently you can assign to applicationbariconbutton an icon present on your project as content
1831_1	0	a	this basically means you have to determine your icons at design time
1831_2	0	a	by providing the ability to assign an icon placed on the isolatedstorage the developer will be free to create button icons at runtime dynamically download them from other places etc
1831_3	0	a	there is no such option to delete the beta app from dashboard
1832_1	1	a	even there should be a option to delete the mpns certificate
1832_2	0	a	i dont believe that there is not adonet
1834_1	0	a	no sql queries to run
1835_1	0	a	must redo all applications from windows mobilemonotouchmonodroidwpf for wp
1835_2	0	a	i have the same core code running on the above platforms but to do it on wp i will have to rewrite
1836_1	0	a	unacceptable
1837_1	0	a	after application migration to the new dashboard use the original product id to bind high german map failure
1838_1	0	a	adding new test users without new submission
1838_2	1	a	posibility to add new test users in realtime mode
1838_3	0	a	it will be more quickly and easier
1839_1	1	a	give ability to create games that have access for xbox live achievements
1839_2	0	a	it doesnt have to be full access
1840_1	0	a	still only partners can have a xbox live mark on their game icon but having a one place for achievements leader boards and friends would be great wp live
1840_2	0	a	some people have had other developers submit apps to the marketplace on their behalf for many reason
1841_1	0	a	they may have been in a country that is not supported for example
1841_2	0	a	more then one developer may have worked on the app and are now splitting
1841_3	0	a	some people may sell their apps to others
1841_4	0	a	in all these cases it breaks the update cycle for existing users because the new owner would have to create a new app instead of updating the existing one
1841_5	0	a	when i create a paid app with a trial option many users blow right by it because it doesnt show up in the free category even though a light version of the app is free via the trial
1841_6	0	a	some people are resorting to the superinefficient apple app store method of releasing versions of the app one that shows up in the free category and another that runs as a paid app
1841_7	0	a	the trial is a fantastic concept but it is hobbled by this oversight
1841_8	1	a	add adonet to the silverlight net framework so you can use datasets when working with xml and relational data via c in windows phone
1841_9	0	a	right now there is no way to sync anything but pictures generated on the phone to the users pc
1841_10	0	a	if i create a word processor style application or something of the sort i have to start integrating with this service or that service on the cloud to get it off the users device
1841_11	0	a	users are sensitive to data usage because it costs them money
1841_12	0	a	none of my customers understand why they cant just connect the phone to thier pcs and the files are automatically synced to a folder dedicated for this
1841_13	0	a	it is especially wierd since they can sync pictures and music
1841_14	0	a	it is especially wierd since they can sync pictures more
1841_15	1	a	i need to write to a bitmap which is very painful imagine a vnc client for example on windows phone right now so please support the copy and writepixels methods and some others
1841_16	1	a	i would like to have one overview with all reviews for all apps
1841_17	0	a	at the moment you have to open the reviews for every app one at the time
1841_18	0	a	if you have many apps like me about it takes a lot of time
1841_19	1	a	maybe you can add an all apps option to the page filter of the reviews
1841_20	0	a	dear team support i was uploading games in windows phone store but from last friday there seems to be some kind of bug in your windows phone store
1841_21	0	a	i have created one new app and reserved its name on that called fightofthelenegs but when i try to create app packages it is not showing in the package list in visual studio
1842_1	0	a	i am unable to understand the reason
1842_2	0	a	please do help me on this so that i can upload another new game in the store itself
1842_3	0	a	i am using visuall studio
1843_2	0	a	updating an app listing that supports multiple languages is one of the most painful experiences when developing for windows
1843_3	1	a	why can we not just have a store manifest that includes all localized descriptions screenshots etc
1843_4	0	a	which will be detected when we upload the app via the dashboard
1843_5	0	a	it would allow us to skip all that crazy input in different languages just to for example swap out one screenshot
1844_1	1	a	alternatively provide an api for the submission process so we can at least somewhat alleviate the pain ourselves
1844_2	0	a	it would be a great way to better integrate applications if there was a sports news hub
1845_1	1	a	i imagine the default setup could simply default to news and sports from msn or one of ms other affiliates then allow rss feeds to be added
1845_2	1	a	enhance that further by allowing rd party application tieins like espns app or news from a bbc or cnn application
1846_1	1	a	ms could even add features like they have in media center for sports such as a ticker feed and fantasy player tracking
1846_2	0	a	support windows server r
1847_1	1	a	controls displaying the sip when focused should provide a method to close the sip to ensure data binding is applied
1847_2	0	a	currently if the user clicks the save button right after using the sip the data entered is not persisted to the object bound to the control
1848_1	0	a	is it possible to put something like microsoftwindowsmobilestatus on the development of your windows phone
1849_1	0	a	purpose events related to when one phone call starts and ends
1849_2	0	a	also something for sms
1849_3	0	a	this is for perform any action on background
1849_4	1	a	allow developers to use an inbuilt api to compress videos captured from the camera using either h or mpeg
1849_5	0	a	sometimes its usefull to explore and tranfer back files generated in app thats running on phoneemulator back to the developer computer without additional coding
1849_6	1	a	remove the recipient cap on app generated sms messages
1849_7	0	a	obviously this is in place to ensure people do not spend lots of money if they dont have unlimited bundles
1849_8	0	a	however a simple message box saying this message is going to be sent to people are you sure you want to send would be sufficient
1849_9	0	a	this system for featuresuggestion is good but i miss the feedback to the feedback
1849_10	0	a	at the moment only one idea is marked as planed
1849_11	0	a	even some of the ideas will ship in the next update they havent marked as planed or startet
1849_12	0	a	which would give the people that use this platform give a positive feedback and get there votes back without manualy search for votes they no longer need because it will be provided in the next update
1850_1	0	a	the company for i works loose a project because one of the clients requirements is change the windows wallpaper ringtones and other features that are no disponible in windows phone
1850_2	0	a	the project will be developed in andriod
1850_3	1	a	please allow us to maintain all app packages store assets descriptions screenshots and metadata in a git repository and simply push to a git remote to upload
1850_4	0	a	currently it is very tedious and takes hours to submit an app update especially when you have multiple app packages and lots of languages
1850_5	0	a	you have to manually use the website to change descriptions switch languages lots of copy and paste remove each screenshot put a new screenshot
1850_6	0	a	it literally takes hours and it drives you crazy
1850_7	0	a	instead we could get everything ready locally and do a push and upload it all quickly
1851_1	0	a	currently apps are executed in sandboxes and theres no way to apps can work together
1852_1	0	a	one app to look up information in the internet opens up another app that can scan barcodes
1852_2	0	a	the same is true for applications and the os itself
1853_1	1	a	some kind of handlers on context menus of certain objects would be great
1853_2	0	a	the context menu of images could list tasks provided by apps dealing with images
1853_3	0	a	in more detailedextremely simplified what about having an app that rotates an image an app that uploads images into the web and an app that is capable to send an image to the nearest printer
1854_1	0	a	in more detailedextremely simplified what about having an app that rotates an image an app that uploads images into the web and an app that is capable to send more
1854_2	0	a	i dont want use uac is a security risk
1854_3	0	a	but i want have metro apps
1854_4	0	a	application developers currently premango have no facilities to access the c contents of an incoming sms message
1855_1	1	a	it would be great if applications could register for such a capability thus enabling scenarios such as sms challenge authentication
1856_1	1	a	add ability to set referrer and other custom headers when using httpwebrequest
1856_2	0	a	my company likes wp but the nonexistence of visual voicemail is stopping a switch from the iphone
1856_3	0	a	is there a way to access voicemail metadata
1856_4	1	a	distribute more application bar icons in sdk at least each one used by builtin applications provide forummarketplace for other artwork including control templates styles
1856_5	1	a	increase webbrowser control function
1856_6	0	a	google has playbooks and apple has ibooks for better reading of ebooks and there are many third party applications which make easy reading of ebooks but none of theme have inbuilt dictionary and they lack in many features in terms of user experience
1857_1	1	a	it will be nice if window phone or all microsoft devices have onebooks application for reading ebooks and magazines etc
1857_2	0	a	i understand the max size limitation to control
1858_1	0	a	and there are some approach to work around on most of the controls
1858_2	0	a	however for some control eg
1858_3	0	a	textbox its a big problem
1858_4	0	a	socket apis and duplex wcf communication
1858_5	0	a	currently its not possoble to make connections behind proxy servers that require authentication
1859_1	0	a	this very much limits business type apps that can use resources or run apps while connected to a work network
1859_2	0	a	its only currently possible via the web browser
1859_3	1	a	support chinese
1860_1	1	a	allow developers to alteredit an applications metadata including description imagesgraphics pricing and keywords etc once the app is published without resubmitting
1861_1	0	a	this would make bug fixes to spelling and screeshots simple would save microsoft from having to test submissions for metadata only
1861_2	0	a	maybe sending a zip
1861_3	0	a	system supported application error reporting service that would report back to developers application crashes and details
1861_4	1	a	i wish i could simulate multitouch on the emulator ie pinch and zoom with mice
1861_5	1	a	just like the picture extras itd be great if apps like twitter and facebook could register to be on the list of applications that a user can share a piece of text with in addition to email and sms
1861_6	0	a	this enables a number of cross app communication scenarios and lets the user choose how he wants to share that info
1861_7	0	a	this enables caching of and usage of offline maps
1861_8	0	a	until windows phone this part was too painful and took a lot of time and work
1864_1	0	a	hope there are some automated tool for taking localised screenshots
1864_2	0	a	then i navigate to another page press the button and it take n screenshots again one for each language
1864_3	0	a	in the upload website a way to remove all screenshots and a way to upload all assets for all languages at once
1864_4	1	a	provide a precertification tool that runs all the tests the marketplace certification tool runs
1864_5	0	a	so developpers can have more confidence it will pass the tests and fix the issues before submitting to the marketplace
1864_6	0	a	time saver for developers and microsoft
1864_7	0	a	the phone currently plays a large selection of media formats mp mv gp etc that arent supported in the emulator
1864_8	0	a	this makes apps that use these formats extremely hard to debug
1864_9	0	a	would be awesome if you could fix this
1864_10	0	a	just like the picturemusic extras to be able to integrate in a personsphone numbersunkown caller so to add phone services to easy search for numbers or to be able to start a contactmessage app from the contact card
1864_11	1	a	allow applications to register messaging endpoints on device eg
1864_12	0	a	register as a launcherchooser to ease ondevice interapplication communication
1864_13	0	a	when i see the palm pres multitask switch i know there is something ms can do better
1864_14	0	a	hopefully with fluently switch and creative gesture and ui
1864_15	0	a	now we can just use pivot and panoramabut we can not handle their sensitive degreesometimes i feel its so highand i want to edit it but no way to do this
1864_16	0	a	currently only store apps can be submitted to the store
1864_17	1	a	please allow me to submit existing windows desktop software to the store
1866_1	0	a	with all the new screen sizes and resolutions testing in the emulator is certainly one way to try them out but itd aid in even more rapid development to be able to see them on the design surface like we already have for wvga wxga and p sizes
1867_1	0	a	were still missing the p and sizes
1868_1	0	a	currently if we logged in twitterfb or any other social networking sites throug their apis we cant logout
1868_2	0	a	it is because the web browser keeps the cookies
1868_3	0	a	so he cant login into his another account
1868_4	0	a	currently windows phone if you store your credentials in the passwordvault they arent deleted on app uninstall so if you install the app again the last stored credentials are available
1869_1	0	a	i think the credentials needs to be deleted with the app uninstall
1870_1	0	a	creating a modern windows app can require creating a lot of project files one one per platform type windows phone windows phone windows and windows with each project generating its own unique output
1870_2	0	a	even universal app projects create multiple projects one for windows another for windows phone neither of which support the previous versions of windows to note
1870_3	0	a	on ios its possible to target many versions of the os etc
1870_4	0	a	with a single project file
1871_1	0	a	when the app gets built it generates a single package that can be distributed to any version of the os within developerset version limitations
1871_2	0	a	when a new version of the os comes out its possible to upgrade the apps project and still have its output support older versions of the os
1872_1	0	a	windows projects when updated to windows projects lose their ability to support windows
1872_2	0	a	being able to target multiple versions of windows with a single project one that preferably built a single app package would be useful
1872_3	0	a	furthermore upgrading that project to target the latest version of windows shouldnt cause support for the previous version of the os to be lost
1873_1	0	a	ios developers get this feature so should windows developers
1874_1	0	a	when the app gets built it generates a single package that can be more

0_24	0	a	ive encountered an issue in background audio behavior dependent on apps name
0_25	0	a	once it happens in normal usage you wont be able to reinitialize the player at all without restarting the phone
0_26	1	a	once we change the name then everything works all right
0_27	0	a	the problem is probably when the app tryies to access backgroundmediaplayercurrent in ibackgrountaskrun method it fires the background task once again what shouldnt happen
0_28	0	a	ive tested this on newest w build both on emulator and device
0_29	0	a	ive encountered an issue in background audio behavior dependent on apps name
0_30	0	a	ive managed to reproduce it using the official msdn sample and as its hard to testdebug ive published a video with the problem if the name of the app is little longer andor with space inside then after the os cancels the background player not used for some time its not possible to reinitialize it by pressing uvc button the ibacgroundtaskrun method is called twice and without uvc button pressed event
0_31	0	a	once it happens in normal usage you wont be able to reinitialize the player at more
0_32	0	a	some apps can work intensively in background for example it maybe video converting online financial data processing and more
0_33	0	a	wrong text display when write an englishltr word inside an persianfarsi or arabicrtl textsee picture when app language et to english
0_34	1	a	windows phone store should show total number of app downloads all markets as well as ratings and reviews of all markets instead of showing ratesso please make store on phone show total app downloads all over the world as well as total rating and reviews of all regions
0_35	1	a	windows phone store should show total number of app downloads all markets as well as ratings and reviews of all markets instead of showing rates and reviews based on region because it doesnt give a broad view and if by chance in any country there are no reviews on your app and someone want to download your app he might not just because he cant find it first of all cuz no rating second heshe will think app doesnt have any reviews so it is not so good
0_36	0	a	it might happen that app can have so many reviews on other more
0_37	0	a	its great that the dev center now allows multiple users to access the same account and i can submit app packages as a user with the developer role however it would be even better if it allowed users with the developer role to create app packages in visual studio
0_38	0	a	at the moment it is impractical for me as a developer to keep asking my boss for his microsoft account just to create app packages
0_39	1	a	if i search something the first app in the list should be the one with the best user rating and most frequent updates even if the app is not the official one
0_40	1	a	the main problem is that the new users dont know about third party clientsapps so in my opinion this could improve a lot the user experience especially for the new users
0_41	1	a	if i search something the first app in the list should be the one with the best user rating and most frequent updates even if the app is not the official one
0_42	1	a	for example if i search instagram the result should be users favourite apprecomended app tag official app instragram beta and then al the others
0_43	0	a	a lot of official apps are almost completely abandoned like istragram beta but some unofficial clients are really amazing
0_44	0	a	the main problem is that the new users dont know about third party clientsapps so in my opinion this could improve a lot the user more
0_45	0	a	xmlnsdefinitionattribute is an absolutely great attribute for control library developers
0_46	1	a	if you use a rd party control library or youre a control library vendor you should vote for this
0_47	0	a	itll save you a lot of typing looking for controls and types etc
0_48	0	a	xmlnsdefinitionattribute is an absolutely great attribute for control library developers
0_49	0	a	it allows the developers of that control library to greatly simplify the xaml by reducing the number of xmlns declarations they need
0_50	1	a	the only way around this is for the control vendor to throw every single class that might be used in xaml not just controls but other types too in the same namespace creating a very ugly unwieldy api to code against
0_52	0	a	itll save you a lot of typing looking more
0_53	0	a	with the advent of build the vision and direction of microsoft seems to be open source and cross platform
0_54	1	a	please provide consistency throughout the entire microsoft development ecosystem
0_55	1	a	currently you have to provide a splash screen to get your app to pass the certification kit which should really be a developers choice like before
0_56	0	a	currently when you overpan a scrollviewer wheres no way to tell how much negative offset it is unless you do hacks like calculating it every ms via a timer
0_57	1	a	the svg data may be inline or loaded from a source local file or remote from the web there are few current tools for converting svg to wpfsilverlightbased xaml but they fall short when dealing with more complex svg datathis should work just like any other kind of image data
0_58	0	a	some svg files may be dynamically generated by a remote server svg data loaded in a xaml view may have internal named elements
0_59	0	a	i would imagine that thered be a way to access the internal elements from code to manipulate them and attach event handlers hovertouch etc change properties color opacity etc
0_60	0	a	we used this extensively in one javascript project but would have preferred to do this in xaml theres a lot of free source svg files that usable under creative commons on wikipedia for things like us maps electoral districts and many other rich features
0_61	0	a	o its a huge time saver to piggyback on those assets
0_62	0	a	for example suppose you wanted to color a us map by probability of each electoral district voting a certain way
0_63	0	a	this is easily done with some reference data svg from wikipedia
0_64	1	a	problem is theres no way to easily manipulate this within a xaml app i would hope that an svgrenderer element would use similar hardware acceleration that the html renderers use i would not expect to use javascriptcss classes to manipulate svg from a xaml app but bonus points if xaml styles could be plugged in manual conversion to xaml is an extra step in the workflow and leads to duplication of assets
0_65	0	a	a designer may keep tweaking the source image and must keep generating that xaml
0_66	0	a	that xaml would then need to be copied into a resource dictionary and cant be a separate file resource can it
0_67	0	a	the highlevel ask is to support using svg within a xaml tree
0_68	0	a	the svg data may be inline or loaded from a source local file or remote from the web there are few current tools for converting svg to wpfsilverlightbased xaml but they fall short when dealing with more complex svg data
0_69	0	a	here are a few scenarios apps loading svg content from a remote web server

0_72	0	a	there appears to be no way to deploy an app to a windows emulator outside of manually doing so in visual studio
0_73	0	a	without that we have no means to wrap our own tooling to launch and install built apps to the emulator
0_74	0	a	the older tooling appdeploycmdexe would allow us to list the available emulators we could deploy to and deploy to them though its support for devices left a lot to be desired
0_75	0	a	oddly with windows tooling installed and windows sdk we can actually see the list of windows emulators listed in the appdeploycmd output and need to do some postfiltering to separate the and emulators
0_76	0	a	so currently we can use the tooling to get the list of emulators but if we try to deploy to them theyll start up but app deployment will fail
0_77	0	a	in doing some testing it appears winappdeploycmd may work to install an appx on a running emulator if we happen to know the
0_78	0	a	xx ip address of the emulator but i can find no way to get that programmatically either
0_79	0	a	i tried powershell scripts using wmi such as see there appears to be no way to deploy an app to a windows emulator outside of manually doing so in visual studio
0_80	0	a	we also have no entries listed for windows emulators running or not in the devices output
0_81	0	a	the biggest issueask is to deploy an app to an emulator via that command line tool in much the same way the appdeploycmd worked for
0_83	0	a	the older tooling appdeploycmdexe would allow us to list the available emulators we could more
0_84	0	a	in my view the two main use cases for the store search can be summarised as follows as a windows app consumer i want to be able to search for apps by name so that i can find and download the specific app i am looking for
0_86	1	a	as a windows app consumer i want to be able to search for apps by functionality so that i can find and download an app that will help me perform the task i want to carry out
0_87	0	a	an example of the first might be ive heard that wordament is good so ill type wordament into the search box so i can download and play it during my commute to work
0_88	0	a	an example of the second might be i really enjoy doing crossword puzzles so ill type crosswords into the search box so that i can find and download a crossword app that i play during my commute to work
0_89	0	a	the store search heavily favours matching the search term to the app name over matching to the keywords
0_90	0	a	it would seem that the search algorithm has been developed to optimise results for use case one above at the expense of use case two
0_91	0	a	in my view and i can see from the forums and user voice channel that i am not alone in this the store search provides a poor customer experience by not catering effectively for use case two
0_92	1	a	it is my belief that the search algorithm could be improved to cater for use case two without adversely effecting use case one
0_93	0	a	intuitively if a user already knows the name of an app then it is likely that it is already fairly popular and so would be ranked highly in search results without the algorithm favouring the app name
0_94	0	a	in addition app names are quite specific and so searches for facebook and wordament should return a narrow set of results compared to searches for generic terms such as crosswords
0_95	0	a	conversely new apps that are not yet popular would be unknown to consumers and so would only be found when a user browses categories in the store or searches for apps by functionality as in use case two
0_96	0	a	more info in my view the two main use cases for the store search can be summarised as follows
0_97	1	a	as a windows app consumer i want to be able to search for apps by name so that i can find and download the specific app i am looking for
0_100	0	a	an example of the first might be ive heard that wordament is good so more
0_101	0	a	the new start menu features the aero transparency and blur effects we all love
0_102	1	a	in other words i want to be able to create designs such as this providing more design options allows us to diversify our applications interface designs and set it apart from others in the market
0_103	1	a	please support a native connection to sql server over ipport
0_104	0	a	the textbox control is the most used control in a windows program
0_105	0	a	it also cause a lot of problem either from qa or the user because of invalid data that was entered
0_106	0	a	using a masked control will save a lot of time for the developer and reduce the complaints and bugs
0_107	0	a	now with win dashboard the stack trace only provide a snippet of the error which is included in the error lines
0_108	0	a	however with the new dashboard this is the only information that is provided on the dashboard
0_109	1	a	its not enough for devs
0_110	0	a	from modern is a standard c language projection for the windows runtime
0_111	0	a	practically nothing is off limits to the developer hungry for power but you dont need to sacrifice productivity or safety along the way
0_112	0	a	about the only thing that modern prohibits is explicit reference counting
0_113	0	a	it uses cs move semantics to handle reference counting reliably and sparingly
0_114	0	a	from modern is a standard c language projection for the windows runtime
0_115	0	a	the modern compiler produces a headeronly library designed to provide standard c developers with firstclass access to the windows api
0_116	0	a	it takes advantage of c and beyond to provide a truly modern language projection for the windows runtime
0_117	1	a	so while it is still com under the hood a c developer should think in terms of references rather than pointers
0_119	0	a	about the only thing that more
0_120	1	a	would be really helpful to have findancestor api added just like in silverlight and wpf
0_121	1	a	fix the bug app cant be searched in the windows store
0_123	0	a	your app is published and can be found here
0_126	0	a	right now we cant show progress on the taskbar for example to let a user see the current status of a download or something else
0_127	0	a	media player buttons are possible in the taskbar but why not the progressbar
0_128	0	a	weekly or daily email report as provided by other app tracking platforms with summary of downloads reviews and other metrics
0_129	0	a	currently there is no way to schedule recurring notifications using scheduledtoastnotification
0_130	0	a	while http proxy function lost since windows phone now in uwp we can only set http proxyipportusernamepsw in the connected wifi manually
0_131	0	a	typeconverter is helpful because it allows the author of a type to provide intrinsic support for determining tofrom which types a type may be converted and actually converting between types most typically for converting tofrom string but other types as well
0_132	1	a	microsoft support recommended me to post the issue herethere seems to be a longstanding serious issue with the store or possibly the dev portal which needs to be addressed urgently
0_133	0	a	these users are now required to buy the app again to own the app
0_134	0	a	speculation it appears to me that the store is seeing the update as a new app and therefore the original certificate is no longer recognized thereby triggering the symptoms above
0_135	1	a	please implement a permanent fix to the relevant backend systems
0_136	1	a	also we need a supplementary fix to the issues faced by existing affected users without resorting them to contacting microsoft customer support to restore their purchase by way of adding credit to repurchase the app
0_137	0	a	the issue gets complicated when the users owned the app via a free promo and support may not be willing to restore the purchase using this method
0_138	0	a	feel free to contact me if further info is required
0_139	0	a	thank you
0_140	0	a	microsoft support recommended me to post the issue here
0_141	1	a	there seems to be a longstanding serious issue with the store or possibly the dev portal which needs to be addressed urgently
0_142	0	a	theres a history of apps affected by this issue and possibly more apps to be affected in the future if the issue goes unfixed
0_143	0	a	the problem starts after a certain app update
0_144	0	a	the symptoms are as stated in the title
0_145	0	a	certain users who had installed the app prior to the problematic update are affected
0_146	0	a	fresh users are not affected by this issue
0_147	0	a	while it is possible to reinstall the more
0_148	1	a	please create this option native to textbox control its very usefull in winform projects and could speed up development on universal app too
0_149	0	a	there are a lot of feedbacks asking to allow developers to deleteremove apps and iaps from their dev center
0_150	1	a	so i think you should add some hide some option to not only unpublish app but eventually logically remove their entries from the dashboard main app list graphs etc you can eventually add a page where all the appsiaps hidden are listed and there the developer can eventually bring back them to the dashboard in case he changes his mind
0_151	0	a	do you think it can work this way
0_152	1	a	there are a lot of feedbacks asking to allow developers to deleteremove apps and iaps from their dev center
0_153	0	a	these feedbacks were all refused and i can imagine the motivation behind this so i try to formulate better whats really the point is on this if a developer has many unpublished apps or iaps their dashboard start to become a mess and the developer have to see to a lot of not more relevant data regarding to app that there arent no longer maintained or simply products which the developer is not focused right now
0_154	0	a	so i think you should more
0_155	0	a	it is frustrated for a devoloper then an app isnt show in any category and the app can only find per direct search by name
0_156	0	a	inexplicably the uwp does not include the wpf wrappanel that was introduced nearly years ago
0_157	0	a	and with the variablesizedwrapgrid you must hardwire the columnspan and rowspan of each item to ensure everything fits
0_158	0	a	one simple example where the wrappanel is essential is when displaying a tag cloud
0_159	0	a	the wrapgrid makes it possible to display a fully adaptable ui since as the container gets narrower on small screens everything can still be seen
0_160	0	a	but it is not just for tag clouds
0_161	0	a	the wrappanel behavior is how items flow in html
0_162	0	a	it is astounding to me that such a useful ui control one that microsoft built years ago and with behavior that powers nearly every html page in existence was left out of the uwp
0_163	0	a	inexplicably the uwp does not include the wpf wrappanel that was introduced nearly years ago
0_164	0	a	this panel is similar to a stackpanel but if there are too many items to fit in a row the subsequent items are displayed in the next row down
0_165	0	a	there are other panels in the uwp that do something similar like the wrapgrid but this doesnt work well if the items are variable size
0_167	0	a	one simple example where the wrappanel is essential is when displaying a more

0_171	0	a	my app freda is an ebook reader which has been popular and muchdownloaded ever since and its appeared always in the top results for a store search for ebook reader
0_172	0	a	but with the new store ranking algorithm this search produces search results where the following all appear higher up than my app apps with average reviews even in one case apps that have not been updated since apps that last received a review in apps that crash on launch apps that are not ebook readers this is just more
0_173	0	a	the current design documentation at provides only files in powerpoint and adobe illustrator formatsmy company and thousands of others use sketch to develop app interfaces that we then give to our developers
0_174	0	a	none of powerpoint or illustrator files are supported by sketch and viceversa so we need sketch files to start our design work
0_175	0	a	thanks you very much
0_176	1	a	windows runtime should allow public nonsealed classesthis is already implemented for xaml classes now this should be available for all windows runtime components
0_177	1	a	you could also consider implementing this partially for example allow inheritance only between managed winrt classes and deriving managed classes from native winrt classes
0_178	0	a	when uploading screenshots we are given the choice to upload one of the these sizes x x or x pixels i would like to recommend adding the ability to upload screenshots in x pixel size
0_179	0	a	when an error occurs it happens a lot that exceptionstacktrace is null in the app unhandledexception handler for instance

0_919	0	a	please support it if you want to make xaml capable of amazing animations
0_920	0	a	please support smil animations in xaml
0_921	0	a	smil is the best declarative language for animations in the world there is nothing like it
0_924	0	a	smil is the the standard format for animations used both for the web as part of svg and as the official opendocument format for animations and graphic effects currently you cannot include smil and svg animated images in xaml and in ie you need more
0_925	1	a	it would be very useful if developers can get access to the accessory apps api
0_926	0	a	this will bring compatibility of the currently available smart watches such as pebble and metawatch and help startup companies develop their own accessories and bring it to windows phone
0_927	0	a	most of the current accessories currently work with ios and android
0_928	0	a	follow touch enablement of mobile platforms and enable the list controls by default to have a tap top area that scrolls to top of list automatically
0_929	0	a	i use directd to render complex shapes and animations
0_930	1	a	i would like to include them in my xaml layouts
0_931	0	a	the existing solutions like swapchainpanel have many limitations like transparency layering xamldirectdxaml is not possible directd effects cannot be applied to xaml content eg text etc
0_932	0	a	one solution would be that xaml finally switches to directd for the rendering of shapes and controls
0_933	0	a	this would surely make the integration with directd content much easier
0_934	0	a	on the taskbar setting in the item hide taskbar wish i could ask for the task bar appears only when the ctrl button is pressed and so when i use windows and want the bar to appear as well as position the mouse where she is hides the ctrl button must be pressed
0_935	0	a	for example after purchase an app users receive a unique code or url for same app and them can send to another user and the end user redeem the code or open url for add the app to his accounts
0_936	1	a	make tshell available to all developers not only oem manufacturerson other platforms iphone android such tools as tshell a readily available to all developers
0_937	1	a	opening tshell to developers will provide them with more tools to debug hard bugs understand platforms and develop new tools to make development for wp easier
0_938	1	a	add the ability to send the application for inclusion in the collection of applications storefor example i want to include my wingeochat application in the collection apps for work
0_939	1	a	it would be awesome if for every app on the store instead of doing the traditional feedback system we could do a collaborative system along the lines of uservoicethat way users with similar thoughts would be grouped together the developer would get a better idea of what people want and users can see when developers have considered their feedback
0_940	0	a	windows has a great feedback system
0_941	0	a	microsoft should provide a sdk for developers to intergate such feedback system in their apps
0_942	0	a	for halo fans add downloadable content as a d body of cortana with lip syncing of what she says and interaction when tou click on her like a talikng tom it could be added in external content in the new halo dont know

0_948	0	a	launching app from uri protocol without searching on store rather returning that app not available

0_950	0	a	with uwp an appointmentstore retrieved via requeststoreasyncappointmentstoreaccesstypeappcalendarsreadwrite will still return nonapp calendars from getappointmentcalendarasyncthis is different from the windows phone behavior and inconsistent with findappointmentcalendarsasync which will not return those calendarsthis can give an app the false impression of being able to modify a nonapp calendar until a save is attempted and fails with unauthorized exception

0_953	0	a	when looking at help examples online while working on my code i sometimes run into differences between wpf windows runtime and silverlight but dont realize it right away and end up frustrating myself until i doi see no reason to have variations that are so similar especially with the current efforts to make things universal
0_954	0	a	i think having variations did i forget any
0_955	0	a	does nothing other than cause confusion and frustration and in the case of some people although hopefully not many and definitely not me a reason to leave
0_956	0	a	net
0_957	0	a	if all variations could be merged i think most developers would be able to adjust to it and there would be less confusion in the future

0_963	0	a	if all variations could more
0_964	1	a	developers shouldnt get bad ratings and reviews when something is broken in a preview build just because you release unfinished builds to users who have no idea what preview means other than getting the new cool stuff first

0_982	0	a	this also applies to iconsat present to pin an application to the desktop in all versions of windows one must find the executable file right click on it choose to create a shortcut be told windows cant create a shortcut here and select yes
0_983	1	a	my suggestion is to add an option to pin the application in use for future use when an application is open
0_984	0	a	one way to do this is to provide an option to create a shortcut to the desktop when an application is open
0_985	0	a	one way to do this would be to add such an option when a user right clicks on the application icon on the top left of the window
0_986	0	a	at present the user gets options to move size maximise or close
0_987	1	a	these options are available across the top bar of the window i suggest adding an option to create a shortcut
0_988	0	a	in its simplest form the new shortcut would open the application
0_989	0	a	there might be a flyout with further options to create a shortcut to the application or the current file or create a tile
0_990	0	a	the benefit of this idea would be that i often find that having opened an application i would like to have it easily available to use again
0_991	0	a	at present i have to search for the executable etc
0_992	0	a	i hope this idea is useful and perhaps others could comment on whether it is practical easily implemented or not and any enhancements
0_993	0	a	i apologise if there are better or more appropriate places to post this idea

0_1000	0	a	we end up writing lot of custom styles in xaml for split view
0_1001	1	a	further splitview should have option to display only the button in compact mode
0_1002	0	a	there are few standard patterns for navigation and if split view has those oob then developing apps because a breeze
0_1003	1	a	developers should be focusing more on app as opposed to implement the standard navigation pattern and spend effort on styling

0_1306	1	a	please enhance the new back up function and enable google drive integration
0_1307	0	a	google reader api allows to create feeds like ie
0_1308	0	a	i can import this feed in wordpress or joomla so when i find an interesting article in google reader i simply star it with automatic pubblication in my blog
0_1309	1	a	it would be very nice to have this in feedly
0_1310	0	a	i know it works in ie now not sure about but definately not
0_1311	0	a	im forced to use ie on windows xp at work with no ability to install anything or use portable firefox etc
0_1312	0	a	i am not the only one that has asked for this but comments are lost on closed general ie threads now that feedly works in ie
0_1313	1	a	want to still be able to subscribe to twitter feeds without having to create twitter account
0_1314	1	a	please make an option to login that does not include google
0_1315	1	a	there are a lot of us who want anonomosity in what we are reading
0_1316	1	a	we want it to be between feedly and us only especially now that the government is working to get open access to our google accounts
0_1317	0	a	is this a recent change or something ive just seen
0_1318	1	a	i couldnt find any option in feedly extension to turn this off so ive turned background apps off in chrome but would rather this be an option in feedly
0_1319	0	a	i like that instapaper is an option but its very clunky
0_1320	0	a	clicking the instapaper button in feedly opens a new browser window on the instapaper site and then i have to wait for it to load my account and then i have to click another button to save the article
0_1321	1	a	would be so much nicer if i just clicked the instapaper button in feedly and that was that
0_1322	1	a	it would be cool if there were some way to receive notifications of new posts in the mac os x and ios notification center
0_1323	0	a	doesnt suport the ie
0_1324	0	a	i see blank page
0_1325	1	a	please make update
0_1326	0	a	today i opened chrome
0_1327	0	a	haven installed the feedly extension i did notice that i has some weird tab that decided to add itself
0_1328	0	a	not liking that i thought diabling the extension will solve this
0_1329	0	a	no much problem surfing later i discover that i have to unpin the tab
0_1330	0	a	also the tab does not stay unpinned
0_1331	0	a	this is bad
0_1332	0	a	i didnt put the tab there and i dont want it
0_1333	0	a	get it off
0_1334	0	a	you absolutely cannot do this
0_1335	0	a	i dont care how many votes this suggestions gets if i see it happen again feedly will be dead to me
0_1336	0	a	i will uninstall it everywhere and make it my lifes mission to destroy it
0_1337	1	a	i believe htc blinkfeed is getting a lot of users as well and itll be nice if you guys can reach out to htc to get your apis working with their blinkfeed
0_1338	0	a	i generate a majority of my google reader rss content from manually set up google alerts by setting up google keyword searches and selecting deliver to google reader
0_1339	1	a	can you create a connection between google alerts and feedly so that when i update a feed in google alerts the change will be picked up by feedly
0_1340	1	a	i would like to have the possibility to link readability to feedly
0_1341	1	a	create kippt integration to allow sharing to kipptcom
0_1342	0	a	being able to follow reddit topics from within feedly
0_1343	0	a	currently cloudfeedlycom works only with ie browser which is still rather new to the world especially corporate one
0_1344	0	a	ie is too old and probably too many hacks to support it
0_1345	1	a	but ie would be nice to support
0_1346	0	a	is there any way i can save to pocket directly without opening a separate web page each time
0_1347	0	a	google reader sends new articles every day as a periodical format do kindle mail address being able to send every subscriptions os just located in a folder
0_1348	1	a	better than that would be an option to catch the article text and send it completely not just the resume from rss as some sites do somewhat like the instapaper does
0_1349	1	a	create a separate registrationlogin system independent of a google account
0_1350	0	a	right now if i have two google accounts and separate chrome sessions one for work and one for personal use i cant use feedly across sessions
0_1351	0	a	another win is that right now i have to generate my multifactor authentication code when i try to login to feedly on my ipad which is not always convenient for feed reading purposes
0_1352	0	a	feedly looks nice but newsrob provides a significantly more useful experience for users with lots of feeds
0_1353	1	a	allow a new version of newsrob to use the feedly backend api
0_1354	1	a	promote feedly by having that version of newsrob being re branded with feedly logo
0_1355	0	a	a desktop version that would integrate both online services facebook twitter pinterest with desktop services photoshop outlook messages
0_1356	0	a	i prefer using the reeder on my desktop than feedly on the browser since it opens links on the app helping me focus on my reading
0_1357	0	a	the ifttt ingredient articlecontent does not contain the full article body it saves the st paragraph or nothing at all
0_1358	0	a	we loose the main goal of the use of ifttt
0_1359	0	a	can you enable full article content from the original rss feed
0_1360	0	a	integration with net news wire so we can keep updated on every mac i use nnw for publishing to my blog with marsedit
0_1361	1	a	it would be great if feedly would provide the current count of unread articles to teslaunread which would show that number in the corner of the app icon on nova launcher
0_1362	1	a	maybe you need to contact teslacoil software for information on how to implement that
0_1363	1	a	as an alternative to that you could also create a x widget mimicking the app icon with unread counter
0_1364	0	a	however the downside of that would be that you couldnt place this widget in a homescreen folder
0_1365	0	a	this is very powerful feature
0_1366	1	a	i suggest do it like it is done in the google reader watcher
0_1367	0	a	additional the watcher provided notifications about a number of the unreaded articles
0_1368	0	a	yes i know that the first build of mac os au is as slow as a tortoise
0_1369	0	a	burt the feedly extension seems to be horribly broken
0_1370	1	a	create a webapp for ubuntu so feedly can be integrated into the messaging menu show notification bubbles or indicate the number of unread feeds on the launcher
0_1371	0	a	more info
0_1372	1	a	please enhance the new back up function and enable onedrive as well
0_1373	0	a	right now the only way i can find to make a standalone feedly app with fluid is to use these instructions
0_1374	0	a	i would much rather be able to create a fluid app by using fluid in the normal manner
0_1375	1	a	i just got the new chromecast and one of my first thoughts was that it would be cool to send movies from my feeds straight to the tv
0_1376	1	a	i know i can watch them via mirroring on the computer but something more native would be appreciated
0_1377	1	a	integrate facebook twitter youtube and other social accounts into feedly so i can read the timeline posts and other in feedly
0_1378	0	a	like your facebook news feed could be a feed on feedly
0_1379	1	a	new videos from users you subscribed to on youtube can be a whole feed like migrate the entire home page of your youtube account and put it as a feed here
0_1380	1	a	and twitter tweets from your followers can be another feed
0_1381	1	a	the opml export feature should include tagging data
0_1382	1	a	i would like to be able to switch to another service without losing all of the tags i use to organize my source library
0_1383	0	a	microsoft has a rss platform for a common store of rss feeds across ie and outlook
0_1384	1	a	it would be nice to sync any feeds from that store to feedly
0_1385	1	a	it would eliminate the need for an addon to ie as people can use the native button to have their feeds pulled into feedly
0_1386	1	a	it would be great if there was a feedly plugin for the mozilla thunderbird email client
0_1387	0	a	right now i can have several google apps open in separate tabs in thunderbird
0_1388	0	a	so each morning i start my day with my inbox google calendar and google reader each in their own tab right there together in one app
0_1389	0	a	i love that
0_1390	1	a	with the fazing out of google reader it would be great if feedly could take its place in my third tab
0_1391	0	a	i notice that when viewing full articles tumblr feeds work just great except for photosets
0_1392	0	a	they seem to get out of order and the one in the top right is out of place
0_1393	0	a	its a minor thing but for someone who follows a lot of tumblr blogs it can get annoying
0_1394	0	a	i know you can set a preference to save an article to a read later service instead of saving it to feedly but i like feedlys save feature within the apps
0_1395	0	a	however sometimes id prefer to send an article to instapaper readability or pocket and still have it saved in feedly
0_1396	1	a	could you install something like that under the sharing options
0_1397	1	a	have the app available in the for lion osx in the app store
0_1398	0	a	reading becomes more efficient because spritzing increases the time your brain spends processing content without having to waste time searching for the next word
0_1399	0	a	the direct posting from the feedly to the yammer is much preferred by many of enterprise business persons
0_1400	0	a	currently we can only choose safari and chrome in options
0_1401	1	a	it would be nice to open articles in the browser we actually use like mercury in my case
0_1403	0	a	many of us use beyondpod as the go to app for pod casts
0_1404	0	a	it was easy to integrate with google reader
0_1405	1	a	perhaps a similar situation could be made with feedly
0_1406	0	a	i subscribe to my youtube subscriptions in feedly and so much appreciate this feature
0_1407	0	a	i find it easier to keep up with my subscriptions in feedly than in youtube
0_1408	0	a	however most of the time i just want to get some of those videos added to my youtube playlist watch later
0_1409	1	a	it would be awesome to have a click option to add any youtube video in any post directly to my youtube watch later playlist
0_1410	0	a	im not sure what the deal is with buffer but it seems like a needless step
0_1411	0	a	for some unknown reason it decided to buffer my post until am tomorrow
0_1412	0	a	what the heck
0_1413	0	a	is there an actual reason you cannot share directly to facebooktwitter anymore
0_1414	0	a	is it not allowed
0_1415	0	a	do you not have the proper agreements in place
0_1416	0	a	can you get them
0_1417	0	a	that would be wonderful
0_1418	0	a	im not the first person to post this
0_1419	0	a	look it up
0_1420	0	a	i dislike the fact that you have started to mask users bitly urls with your own feedly links
0_1421	0	a	i realize that your link still pings my link and get the analytics but i have a custom url for a reason
0_1422	1	a	i understand why you might do this for the free version of feedly but i implore you to not mask users custom urls in your upcoming paidpro version
0_1423	1	a	would love a click add to instapaper rather than opening a new window yes i have a password and even the browser javascript bug
0_1424	0	a	thank you
0_1425	1	a	add feedreader to the app center list
0_1426	0	a	right now its connected to the wrong account i have more than one buffer accounts
0_1427	0	a	there is no option to disconnect in any way
0_1428	0	a	i already tried to reinstall the app
0_1429	0	a	share directly with twitter instead of buffer
0_1430	0	a	i am using this app for my ipad and yours for the iphone and laptop
0_1431	1	a	it would be great if you could share the api with the developer allowing a seamless sync amongst the apps as it happens now with google reader
0_1433	1	a	deploy the latest version of feedly so that i can update the app on my kindle fire
0_1434	0	a	it seemed like for a few days feedly was using chrome custom tabs instead of opening links in the external chrome app
0_1435	0	a	it was a little jarring at first but once i realized what was going on i really liked it so why did you quickly remove that feature
0_1436	0	a	so why did you quickly remove that feature
0_1437	0	a	i understand that a lot of people who choose to have links open in chrome may not like it but i really liked having links be added to my chrome history while still feeling like i was in the feedly app
0_1438	0	a	will you be making that an additional option along side open directly in browser
0_1440	1	a	allow for default settings so that when this new defaulting mode is enabled clicking the evernote icon will save with no additional interaction
0_1441	1	a	default tags would also be helpful even better configurable content keyword tagging would be great
0_1442	1	a	have an option to make items open directly in the chrome browser on mobile
0_1443	1	a	please make a feedly widgetgadget for igoogle or equivalent
0_1444	0	a	a chromefirefox extension that shows a counter of unread items with a dropdown that lets the user see the items
0_1445	0	a	similar to the official reader notifier from google
0_1446	0	a	there can be apps installed in system that catch http url and display its content inside itselves
0_1447	0	a	builtin browser of feedly brakes such behavior
0_1448	0	a	pushbullet is an amazing sharing app
0_1449	0	a	it pushes stuff from your one device to other as well as to other person
0_1450	0	a	sometimes when i am reading a feed and i want to share it directly with a person it is very easy to to push it to someone
0_1451	1	a	i know it already does that for android app well because android os lists all the apps that keep sharing capability when i hit share icon in the feedly app but it would be awesome to have it in the web app
0_1452	1	a	basically instead of having to manually install the firefox plugin every time theres an update it should auto update
0_1453	1	a	maybe you should consider including the plugin in the firefox addon repomarketplace
0_1454	1	a	would be great to be able to read my feedly feeds on ighomecom instead of having to go to feedlycom
0_1455	0	a	so flipbook sort of did this but they did it awful and i unistalled
0_1456	1	a	yes i want feedly to replicate google reader but i want it to do more
0_1457	1	a	can you bring in my twitter feed and know which ones ive already read
0_1458	1	a	ie do that google readerfeedly does for rss but with twitter or facebook or pinterest
0_1459	1	a	give me one place to consume everything but only see it once unless i save it
0_1460	0	a	ohhh that would be awesome
0_1461	0	a	feedly client doesnt support android so i was forced to use alternative android apps
0_1462	0	a	i tried more than on my nook simple touch
0_1463	0	a	and all of them have the same problem when trying to log into feedly
0_1464	0	a	after entering google username and password i get onto the moved temporarily page
0_1465	0	a	after clicking on the only link on the page i get an empty page
0_1466	1	a	offering other ways to log in or even feedlys own registration system might also help
0_1467	0	a	every time i restart chrome feedly mini appears on every web page
0_1468	0	a	i want to turn it off
0_1469	0	a	ive updated my preferences which works until i close the browser and restart it then my preference is set to show it again
0_1470	0	a	i have tried the greader and press android clients
0_1471	0	a	both show we a google login in a web view within their apps
0_1472	0	a	this is insecure because i cannot verify that i am not phished and that i am talking directly to google
0_1473	1	a	such a login process should not be allowed
0_1474	1	a	login should go through the google account stored on the android device
0_1475	1	a	make the safari extension open the feedly page in a new tabwindow when clicking the feedly button similar to the safari greader extension
0_1476	1	a	i didnt see anyone else suggest this but i would think it would be very simple for flip board to add support for your service
0_1477	0	a	i see no reason why they wouldnt because i know they transferred over a bunch of google reader feeds but they arent doing what feedly is
0_1478	0	a	would be nice to have
0_1479	1	a	would love the ability to monitor specific pages that dont have rss feeds at set intervals and be able to vary the alert options such as getting an email etc when the pages change
0_1480	0	a	thanks and please keep up the great work
0_1481	0	a	can i only not find it or is it really gone
0_1482	0	a	since today i cannot send to instapaper anymore which was very useful for me
0_1483	0	a	i am using safari
0_1484	0	a	of my blogs are music blogs and id say of posts have soundcloud streams embedded into them
0_1485	0	a	to visit the sites externally for every page is not very convient
0_1486	0	a	could you make this happen
0_1487	0	a	google reader never did but i suspect thats because they quit investing rd into improvements
0_1488	1	a	allow us to import twitter lists and view them like regular feeds
0_1489	1	a	support login with twitter facebook microsoft yahoo vk account etc and remove google account login support
0_1490	1	a	allow android app to provide an option to open within the application or open in a browser
0_1491	0	a	i have read that you did have tumblr integration and then it was gone
0_1492	0	a	like a send to tumblr button and liking posts from tumblr feeds
0_1493	1	a	i assume there was problems with it but some of us really use it and it would be great to have it back
0_1494	0	a	so far this is the best feed reader ive tried
0_1495	0	a	please consider it
0_1496	0	a	thanks
0_1497	0	a	on android devices it is hard to add new feeds to feedly
0_1498	0	a	you cant use paste in the search barfield and you cant use feedly as a sharing option in other android apps dolphin browser etc
0_1499	0	a	it is really annoying to remember every interesting site until i can use a desktop computer
0_1500	1	a	please please add an option to easily add content by using a mobile device
0_1501	0	a	thanks
0_1502	1	a	make a chrome packaged app for feedly please
0_1503	0	a	so i can launch feedly from google desktop app launcher
0_1504	0	a	im talking about just integrating my stream followed tumblrs that is reading not posting
0_1505	0	a	i keep reading that feedly has tumblr integration but cant find it anywhere
0_1506	1	a	i just want my tumblr content to show up as articles without having to add every single one as rss
0_1507	0	a	i keep reading that thats possible but cant find any setting or even anyone explaining how its done
0_1508	1	a	if it is indeed possible maybe a short howto in the help section is in order
0_1509	1	a	if it isnt that would also be great to have clarified somewhere faq maybe
0_1510	0	a	youtube video work fine on feedly but somehow vimeo video is not showing the content instead showing error
0_1511	0	a	take a the verge for example
0_1512	0	a	better support for podcasts
0_1513	0	a	i use beyondpod on my android phone and it supported integration of sorts with feedly
0_1514	1	a	my desire is to be able to catch up on podcasts either on my phone or on my desktop such that if ive listened to a podcast completely from either source ie from my browser at home or work or on my cell phone that the episode would be marked listened to or read and disappear from the list in feedly on any of my machines as well as drop off of my beyondpod list
0_1515	1	a	ideally if feedly and beyondpod could get together and synchronize the position within a podcast would be excellent
0_1516	0	a	that said as a podcast player feedly leaves a lot to be desired
0_1517	0	a	from what i can tell merely starting to play a podcast marks it as read or essentially completely listened to
0_1518	0	a	furthermore if i am careless and click somewhere else like to read another article feedly will stop the playback and go to the place i clicked
0_1519	1	a	it should warn me
0_1520	1	a	finally a popout player would be nice for the audiovideo of podcasts
0_1521	0	a	chrome extension required too much permissionextension can access your data on all websites
0_1522	1	a	please reduce required permission for chrome extension
0_1523	1	a	work with soundgecko so anything i mark in feedly goes to soundgecko for readout
0_1524	1	a	feedly should let users login through mozilla persona or gravatar which dont track users
0_1525	0	a	persona is made by the makers of the firefox browser and gravatar is made by wordpress
0_1526	0	a	i would like to change my log in for feedly so that it does not match my google account which contains other personal data
0_1527	0	a	how
0_1528	0	a	i cba to leave feedly but i want to know what other people are saying and i want to be able to contribute without signing up to anything
0_1529	1	a	if a blog does use disqus the comments should be viewable and a reply able to be added directly from feedly
0_1530	1	a	make appextensionplugin for all browsers with one click to add feed from any website
0_1531	0	a	there are some private blogs on wordpresscom
0_1532	0	a	you can subscribe to them in wordpress reader once you have access to them but you cant use them outside wordpress
0_1533	0	a	when you could connect your feedly to your wordpresscom account why shouldnt you be able to subscribe to them
0_1534	0	a	i dont know if wordpress has an api for this
0_1535	1	a	i guess such a feature would be a big advantage for your service
0_1536	0	a	even though i am logged in to google in the same browser and ive already logged in to feedly with my google account and granted access to use what it wants it still keeps logging me out then making me go through this process every couple of days why
0_1537	1	a	i wish as feedly pro user if i save the feeds in evernote i want to tag the note not only the notebook but also the tag of evernote
0_1538	0	a	the utm parameter added to your links breaks them at some sites
0_1539	0	a	case in point new york magazine
0_1540	0	a	creating a win win situation for readers and content creators
0_1542	1	a	further thoughts feedly could develop subscription options for content creators
0_1543	0	a	ie feedly handles payment and delivery of information creator creates information and receives revenue
0_1544	0	a	readers get access to contributiononly content
0_1545	0	a	its been seen over time how simple barriers can stop people from doing activities that they want to do and that benefit them and others
0_1546	1	a	i would like to see better integration with google services across the board specifically gmail google and google drive
0_1547	1	a	i would like the ability to email articles with gmail post them to google and save them to google drive cause google doesnt own quite enough of my soul yet
0_1548	0	a	though this idea has been expressed to varying degrees with regard to specific services like google translate ive not seen it expressed generally
0_1549	0	a	this option existed before
0_1550	0	a	now i have to go the the source article to have the option to post to a linkedin group
0_1551	0	a	its a relatively minor detail but it would be really convenient
0_1552	1	a	import rss from other readers
0_1553	0	a	beyond pod is my main feed reader when i am not on my computer
0_1554	0	a	i like it because of its built in browser and various settings for feeds and podcasts which the google reader app didnt have
0_1555	1	a	please consider speaking to the people of beyond pod to integrate with their app
0_1556	0	a	feedly is beautiful and i would love to use it on my windows phone
0_1557	1	a	allow publishers to trigger feedly to refresh feedlys cached version of their rss feeds
0_1558	0	a	feedly doesnt seem to notice when existing feed content for a datetime changes and refresh their cache
0_1559	1	a	letting publishers trigger that refresh could be a work around when there are errors in the publishers feed
0_1560	1	a	add integration with trello
0_1561	0	a	evernote sharing in feedly seems to cause the chrome evernote plugin to sign out the user and then feedly takes you to a web page version of evernote rather than using the evernote plugin clipper to push it directly into the application or push it transparently to the web
0_1562	0	a	i just see a blank screen on ie
0_1563	0	a	since its my work computer i cant control the software upgrade
0_1564	0	a	if you dont fix that i will seriously consider droping feedly
0_1565	1	a	chromecast support would be great so i could read my news on big screen
0_1566	1	a	i love how you have pintrest integration on your images please consider adding gimmebar integration as well
0_1567	0	a	the type of users on gimmebar vs pintrest is night and day
0_1568	0	a	great app
0_1569	0	a	gimme bar
0_1570	0	a	as above
0_1571	1	a	id love to be able to export all of my saved for later articles to my kindle so i can read it via eink
0_1572	0	a	i used to subscribe to instapapers premium service and it exported all of my articles into a kindle book with a table of contents etc
0_1573	1	a	i feel like this might be easy to integrate with a service thats already up and running like sendtoreadercom or i would gladly pay to have the option for feedly to do it on its own and send to my kindle
0_1574	0	a	feedly allows folder order to be rearranged instead of appearing in alphabetical order
0_1575	0	a	this is useful to me as id prefer that a group or groups of feeds in some folders appear at the bottom of the all items view
0_1576	0	a	i changed the folder order via the feedly web interface organize but the changes in folder order are not being reflected in mr reader
0_1577	0	a	i logged out of then back into the feedly account in mr reader but the folders are still appearing in ascending alphabetical order
0_1578	1	a	please enhance your api
0_1579	0	a	i rarely use google plus but there are few very interesting people using it whos post id like to read
0_1580	0	a	for example linus torvalds
0_1581	1	a	on feedly android app when i share something through email it goes straight to gmail app when i rather want to use the regular email app on that plataform
0_1582	1	a	make it possible for us to choose the mail app we want to use
0_1583	0	a	as a feedly users we all know the pain of having to deal with truncated feeds
0_1584	0	a	this problem becomes more prevalent when using mobile apps that rely on feedly like press on android
0_1585	1	a	i would like to request the capability to run articles through the readability mobilizer before theyre inserted into our feeds
0_1586	0	a	this would help to solve the problem of truncation and poor article formatting
0_1587	0	a	i have missed the email subscriptions feature of the old pre bloglines ever since they discontinued it
0_1588	0	a	i would gladly become a feedly pro subscriber if you offered something comparable
0_1589	1	a	in a nutshell you could create a bunch of random email addresses that you could use when subscribing to newsletters etc and then any emails sent to one of those addresses would show up as a standard html feed
0_1590	0	a	this was fantastic for those sites which offer more content in their email newsletter than their rss feed or lack an rss feed completely
0_1591	1	a	a perfect use case for this would be to turn twitterfacebooketc notifications on and forward those to these email addresses instead of having them clog up my inbox
0_1592	0	a	this could be used for any of these closed services which do not offer rss feeds
0_1593	0	a	the closest solution to this i have found is to use mailinator to create the throwaway emails and they support rss feeds but they also strip out all imagesattachmentsetc and generate plain text feeds so this isnt a good solution
0_1594	0	a	please consider adding this type of feature to feedly
0_1595	0	a	in igoogle there was the google reader gadget
0_1596	0	a	one of the very popular alternatives to igoogle is netvibescom
0_1597	1	a	it would be cool if there was a feedly gadget for netvibes
0_1598	0	a	oembed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a url on third party sites
0_1599	0	a	eagerly waiting on connection with evernote
0_1600	0	a	there are my tags i use daily
0_1601	0	a	the way flipboard has implemented twitter is that it grabs the content in the tweet and displays it so rather than a user having to click a link to read an article or view an image it simply gets the article content or image and displays it with any text of the tweet acting as a caption
0_1602	1	a	it would be great if i could integrate my twitter account into feedly the same way and have full images or articles displayed alongside my rss images and articles
0_1603	0	a	soundgecko is a great way to be able to listen to articles that you want to read later while in the car or on the go
0_1604	0	a	i use it every day
0_1605	1	a	i would love to have direct integration so that i can easily send articles to soundgecko from within the feedly app
0_1606	0	a	ive only noticed this on two feeds my own blog and xkcds
0_1607	0	a	in both cases what should be a floatleft is actually changed in the code to a floatright
0_1608	0	a	see attached
0_1609	0	a	this does not occur in google reader where the original layout displays normally
0_1610	0	a	since the attribute isnt changed in reader i concluded that the problem is with feedly not the rss feed itself
0_1611	1	a	please enhance the new back up function and enable local drive integration
0_1612	0	a	this would allow anyone to back up to dropbox googledrive synology cloudstation microsoft onedrive or any other cloud solution which has a local drive representation in addition to allowing me to save it on a local machine
0_1613	0	a	i can login into my account for the past days
0_1614	0	a	i was logging in using my google credentials
0_1615	0	a	the oauth screen is popping up and hanging
0_1616	1	a	it would be nice to be able to add usenet newsgroup in add content such as comp
0_1617	0	a	mailing list would be great as well great job
0_1618	1	a	something like antennapod would be very nice
0_1619	1	a	maybe you could send them an api or something so they can add the option to sync with feedly once greader disappears
0_1620	1	a	it would be super useful if you are able to choose your own default email app
0_1621	0	a	not everybody uses the gmail app as default some others use cloudmagic mailbox inbox k and such
0_1622	0	a	please guys make it happen
0_1623	0	a	i cannot login to my feedly account using windows microsoft edge even after deleting all cookies etc
0_1624	0	a	i can still login with iexplore
0_1625	0	a	i cannot tell if this is a problem with edge or with feedly
0_1626	0	a	google reader allows you to get a public rss feed for each categorylabel used
0_1627	0	a	is very useful for sharing feeds using it with wordpress blogrolls ecc
0_1628	1	a	it would be great if google button opened an app on iosif it is installed
0_1629	0	a	i used google reader to get the best posts from many blogs and share them through my own blog hosted in blogger
0_1630	0	a	google reader had the option send to blogger
0_1631	0	a	thats the only feature i am missing in feedly
0_1632	0	a	i can add my tumblr blogs to my groups to read them but if i want to like them i have to open the page in another browser window
0_1633	1	a	it would be nice if we could get the tumblr heart right in the feedly page like how we can save for later
0_1634	1	a	reblog support would be nice too but mostly just like at least
0_1635	0	a	i know of many folks including yours truly who use feedly in conjunction with pocket
0_1636	0	a	i noticed that buffer and evernote each have a keyboard shortcut in the web interface
0_1637	1	a	my feature request is rather straightforward add a similar shortcut for save to pocket
0_1638	0	a	for example if you want to have a feed with a particular tracked tag from tumblr feedly could create a feed
0_1639	0	a	for example if you want a feed for every tumblr feed containing the hashtags retail design would be a feedly feed
0_1640	0	a	the current version of your chrome web app does not behave correctly when you click the icon of a chrome web app this should bring an existing open window or tab to the front or in case of a window minimize it into the chrome launcher or maximize it from there feedlys web app however keeps on opening a new window or tab everytime you click on it
0_1641	0	a	the current version of your chrome web app does not behave correctly
0_1642	0	a	when you click the icon of a chrome web app this should bring an existing open window or tab to the front or in case of a window minimize it into the chrome launcher or maximize it from there
0_1643	0	a	that can really drive you nuts as there is almost no other web app that does this google being the stupid other exception of the rule
0_1644	1	a	please fix this by updating the manifestjson file inside the app
0_1645	0	a	it should be enough to make the urls match the actual url of the open app
0_1646	1	a	so in case you switch to do use that in the manifest too
0_1647	0	a	currently if theres a link to an app in the google play store it opens in the feedly browser instead of using the play app which is frustrating
0_1648	0	a	this is just one example of many so it seems to be a problem with opening in the browser only
0_1649	0	a	we should have the choice
0_1650	0	a	for instance feedpress cant see how many people subscribe to feeds through feedly
0_1651	1	a	please allow some way for rss services to get access to that data especially since feedly is so big
0_1652	0	a	right now its a black box
0_1653	0	a	fix it if you can
0_1654	1	a	how about giving feedly compatibility with if this then that
0_1655	0	a	posting to pocket via the chrome extension is currently very laborious opens in a separate tab then loads all your pocket stories every time
0_1656	1	a	pending more straightforward integration with pocket how about allowing us to send our entire saved list straight to pocket
0_1657	1	a	you reader is nearly unusable with tools that allow mouseless browsing vimperator pentadactyl please replace all links you emulated with divs eg menu on the left with real hrefs so these are found by such tools
0_1658	1	a	let the content creators see that their content is viewed in your service like
0_1659	0	a	i add rss source by click the rss icon on the url bar on chrome but with feedly i cant do it
0_1660	0	a	please make a way to do that
0_1661	0	a	rendering is messed up in ie and
0_1662	0	a	im super grateful that you guys got it working at all by july st but this is something that will need to be fixed
0_1663	0	a	when showing news as just title lines in chrome itll show title per line so to say and the st line of the article is revealed after the title or upon clicking on it
0_1664	0	a	in ie every news line is effectively lines line for the title then the st line of the article starts and goes on for a full nd line
0_1665	0	a	this looks really weird and is quite distracting when trying to read my rss
0_1666	1	a	again super grateful you guys got it working somewhere other than chrome a life saver since i can only use ie on my windows rt tablet but this needs to be fixed eventually
0_1667	1	a	when saving to pocket in this case a third party app having visual feedback that the save is happening would be useful
0_1668	0	a	i have performed a save multiple times as its not always instant a limitation of integrating with a third party i understand
0_1669	1	a	maybe the press to save could change the item color until saved and the save icon could be disabled until it is saved
0_1670	0	a	now that we have a wonderfully awesome evernote integration its time to make it easier to use
0_1671	1	a	i have quite a few notebooks and would like to be able to select one notebook as a default so i can simply click the evernote icon and voila the article saved to my default notebook
0_1672	0	a	when i send content from feedly web to evernote the formatting comes across wonky and unclear
0_1673	0	a	when i send it from other similar tools like mr reader it comes across as an article and without the extra content from the website
0_1674	1	a	i wish to add content in evernote with the clearest formatting i can so it needs to be better than feedly currently supports
0_1675	1	a	many people want you to get rid of the need for an extension and make feedly a purewebbased app
0_1676	0	a	so do i
0_1677	0	a	if youre not going to please explain why not
0_1678	1	a	what i really want are gmailstyle filters for feeds to automatically star or mark as read based on matches
0_1679	0	a	a typical example if article subject contains this week in mark it as read
0_1680	1	a	if article body contains my name star it and send to instapaper
0_1681	1	a	i think ifttt integration could get us there with not too much in the way of additions add trigger with pattern or keyword matching on subject sender body etc add mark as read as an action
0_1682	0	a	it should be possible to specify actions in ifttt that mark articles as read when triggered
0_1683	1	a	i would like to do some action when new articles show in some categories but i dont want to see them anymore in feedly after this action is executed
0_1684	0	a	lots of blogs contains latex code to display mathematical characters
0_1685	1	a	this should display as the characters themselves rather than just as the code
0_1686	1	a	alpha should be the greek letter alpha and so one
0_1687	0	a	this would make it much easier to read philosophical and mathematical blogs
0_1688	0	a	pages created with wordpress allow this
0_1689	0	a	this would allow you to minimize the rights required for users interested only in the reader
0_1690	0	a	keyword filtering deleting articlesauthors not of interest prevent unwanted articles from being grabbed by ifttt
0_1691	0	a	some tumblrs i read have passwords on them
0_1692	1	a	itd be great to have a way to add these feeds to feedly by allowing us to enter the password once from feedly
0_1693	1	a	make it possible for me to open articles and links inside articles in safari from within feedly
0_1694	1	a	i am looking for something like this but for feedly
0_1695	1	a	create delicious integration to allow sharing to deliciouscom
0_1696	0	a	the side area allows you to include your facebook and twitter feed
0_1697	1	a	if youre using feedly as your homepage a quick overview of upcoming events might be nice
0_1698	1	a	please let me sign in with an id and password i chose not my google account
0_1699	1	a	id like to connect articles with items in my calendar
0_1700	0	a	eg i read an article about concert and add an item to calendar attaching link to article
0_1701	0	a	or i read an article about grant or scholarship and create calendar item for documents submission deadline attaching link to article
0_1702	0	a	im limited to ie on windows xp at work
0_1703	0	a	all i get is the same white screen all the ie and ie users are complaining about
0_1704	1	a	is there anything you can do to make feedly work on ie
0_1705	0	a	hi few day ago i have started using you excelent app but one thing annoying me
0_1706	0	a	my favorite web page which id is not acceptable by your app
0_1707	0	a	could you fix it
0_1708	0	a	hello feedly developers here is a proposal on how to create a win win situation for readers and content creators
0_1709	0	a	flattr is still not lifting mainly due to a lack off content creators willing to register themselves at flatter
0_1710	0	a	also flatters prototypish content search function makes it hard for users to find proper content
0_1711	0	a	feedly has a user friendly interface with a pretty reliable search function and share options to several other applications
0_1712	1	a	it might be an idea to add a flatter function to feedly
0_1713	1	a	alternatively a simple flattrinspired donate function might do it
0_1714	1	a	feedly pro readers sign up for the donate option where they can donate an amount of money for articles they liked
0_1715	1	a	the amount of the donation is up to the user the user pays in advance into his proaccount and may spend that money for article donations
0_1716	0	a	as a feedback a graphical representation of number and amount of donations and how many readers have read andor donated a certain article is shown
0_1717	0	a	in this way the current intransparent recommendation count would become more transparent
0_1718	1	a	all articles can be donated too
0_1719	1	a	the donated money will be transferred to all publishers who are interested in getting donations similar to unclaimed flatters
0_1720	1	a	bloggersauthors who want to claim their money do this by registering their rssfeed and bank or paypalaccount at feedly
0_1721	1	a	after registration unclaimed donations will be transferred from donator to author
0_1722	1	a	feedly keeps a certain percentage of the donation as an administration fee
0_1723	0	a	benefits gives readers an easy way to support the authors and content they like
0_1724	0	a	gives content creators an additional revenue model
0_1725	0	a	gives feedly an additional revenue model
0_1726	0	a	opens up further possibilities around subscription paidonly content contributors influencing content creators etc
0_1727	1	a	feedly could reinvent the way we consume articles in the same way how amazons kindle unlimited did with the book market
0_1728	1	a	an easytouse donatefunction might turn feedly pro into a universal news portal for factbased quality news
0_1729	0	a	this function might change the independent news market in a similar way as amazons kindle unlimited did to the book market and might attract both readers and authors to sign up for a feedly account
0_1730	0	a	anyway the most important feature is to find the simplest way to transfer money from articlereaders to articleauthors
0_1731	0	a	feedly could be the perfect platform for that
0_1732	0	a	i have two twitter accounts that i use regularly one for work and a personal account
0_1733	0	a	i often post to both from feedly but this requires a lot of logging in and out
0_1734	0	a	integration with tweetdeck would allow me to easily post to either account
0_1735	0	a	i often want to read articles at a later time in safaris readling list
0_1736	1	a	would love to have a direct link to do this
0_1737	1	a	do you think its possible to mod this little software google reader notifier by yonizaf to notify us when new feedly feeds are available
0_1738	0	a	currently in browser and mobile version one has often to do two step navigation to go to original content eg youtube rss for uploads in browser and mobile version it embeddes video which is not what some of us want
0_1739	1	a	i prefer to see original content most of the time so along with mark as read save links there could be url link which will drive to the original site
0_1740	0	a	applies to browser and mobile versions
0_1741	1	a	it would be awesome to play all videos one by one like in a playlist but without a hassle of creating one
0_1742	0	a	i often have many short videos which i have to click individually which is pretty annoying when i want to do sth else and not touch computer
0_1743	0	a	feedly is a website
0_1744	0	a	luakit is a browser
0_1745	1	a	i should be able to use feedly in luakit
0_1746	0	a	i understand that offline support is being worked on and cant wait to use that functionality however since google reader is shutting down within weeks and byline reader is the only offline reader currently available for commuters it would be fantastic if you could work together
0_1747	1	a	unfortunately they only pull their feeds from google reader
0_1748	1	a	the android app is missing a mark as unread option
0_1749	1	a	it would be great if you could add a link bookmark right into your diigo account while reading in feedly
0_1750	0	a	i am a blogger and i want to make it easy for people to subscribe by having a flare unit for them to add my feed to their feedly but i simply cannot find a working flare unit to add to my feedburner
0_1751	0	a	and i seem to be having trouble making one of my own
0_1752	1	a	please create and host a flare unit and provide the url for bloggers to easily add this option for their readers who use feedly
0_1753	0	a	sina weibo is a service like twitter in chinait has biggest market share
0_1754	1	a	i can use flipboard to access my feeds in sina weibo but i like feedly better so if it can be done in feedly it will be great for me
0_1755	0	a	now it shows recent items which makes it unusable
0_1756	0	a	i cannot see more and have to go to fb website anyway so the integration is not useful at all
0_1757	0	a	the button to subscribe to rss with feedly in firefox actually does nothing
0_1758	0	a	some articles include slideshows with article information that have to be viewed with a swipe action
0_1759	0	a	because feedlys swipe action moves to the next feed its not possible to view the slideshow
0_1760	0	a	either allowing a function to go to a webpage in your internet browser outside of feedly or using another action to view the slideshow
0_1761	0	a	other similar apps have this functionality it would be quite useful to my workflow at least
0_1762	1	a	since you can integrate with twitter it would be nice to have my saved links across both platforms show up in a nice readable format in feedly
0_1763	1	a	id like to have feedly automatically detect youtube videos in feeds and if i save a post with a youtube embed automatically add that specific video to my watch later feed in youtube
0_1764	0	a	this way i can pull up the youtube app on my phone or tablet later and watch these videos on my chromecast
0_1765	1	a	make the feedly reader browser extension more like the google reader extension
0_1766	1	a	add a drop down menu of the sources with number of unread items in list the latest unread articles in a scrollable manner and add a mark all as read button and the link to the feedly reader
0_1767	1	a	maybe you could also add a link to the preferences and please make sure that clicking a link to an article marks it as read in feedly thanks
0_1768	0	a	footnote popovers as used on many popular blogs and wikipedia display the footnote itself within a popup bar or text bubble right next to the main article text it relates to
0_1769	0	a	in a properly formatted rss article the reading app will display the footnote inline and not require invoking the web browser and going online
0_1770	1	a	can feedlys rss parser be made to not break this functionality please
0_1771	1	a	i want to open feeds outside of feedly sometimes and look at the site it came from
0_1772	0	a	i prefer to use chrome and it crashes constantly in feedly on my ipad if i browse beyond the article s page
0_1773	0	a	its a more stable option that selecting chrome as the preferred browser in feedly
0_1774	1	a	also we should have the choice i am not going to leave feedly its a great app
0_1775	1	a	just looking for an option that lets me list my articles from oldest to newest like i have it in the on the site
0_1776	1	a	im looking for a consistent experience
0_1777	1	a	i currently use newsblur but id love to transfer all my feeds via opml to feedly
0_1778	1	a	unfortunately feedlys opml support is artificially limited to google readers exact opml format but theres no reason we cant expand it to handle newsblurs opml download format for importing into feedly
0_1779	1	a	let us configure the directory and file names when saving to dropbox with tokens like year month date feedname postdate etc
0_1780	0	a	when you click on an rss feed in firefox it shows you a preview of the current feed with an option to subscribe to it
0_1781	0	a	but the current add on doesnt add an option to the list of programs to subscribe using
0_1782	0	a	ive tried adding it manually but it doesnt work and in any case it shouldnt be that awkward
0_1783	1	a	also would be nice to petition firefox devs to have it as standard
0_1784	1	a	please remove unsaved items from dropbox or add a preference
0_1785	0	a	would also mitigate this
0_1786	1	a	allow all your saved for later items to be exported as a bookmark file in a similar format to the firefox and google chrome bookmarks export tool
0_1787	0	a	this will allow bulk importing of saved for later items into tools like pinboardin
0_1788	0	a	i just cant use the chrome extrension
0_1789	0	a	it wont allow me to log in the window containing the form is closed as soon as the form has finished loading
0_1790	0	a	i love feedly its a really wellprogrammed app
0_1791	0	a	nevertheless theres one thing that annoys me
0_1792	0	a	when i press a link in an article that i am reading on feedly then the link will always open inside feedly
0_1793	0	a	there is no option to open the link directly in the browser safari or in my case chrome
0_1794	0	a	sometimes its necessary to open links in the browser out of convenience and sometimes for usability
0_1795	0	a	usually i end up opening the link in feedly wait for the site to load and then i go into the options menu to open the site once more in chrome
0_1796	1	a	it would be so much easier just to have a contextmenu item that gives the option to open a link directly in the browser
0_1797	0	a	support for reading latest gmail mails directly from inbox feed just the same as igoogle
0_1798	0	a	when i switch in ios to another application eg to translate a word and switch back again the reader goes to a title page instead staying on the page i was reading which is not pleasant
0_1799	1	a	possibly some translation functionality might be useful
0_1800	0	a	we can set the preferred browser on ios this rocks
0_1801	0	a	however if i then click on sharing and google plus it opens in safari
0_1802	1	a	my suggestion is to honour the preferred browser if chosen when using more generic based web sharing services
0_1803	0	a	i do not need all the pro features
0_1804	1	a	id love to pay year just for evernote integration though
0_1805	0	a	this function is currently available in the gmail and pocket ios apps in which a button appears at the top left corner of the chrome browser which will allow the user to quickly return to feedly when they view a page in chrome from feedly
0_1806	0	a	more convenient than using multitask function
0_1807	0	a	integration or support to work with net news wire for mac and reeder and instapaper for ios
0_1808	0	a	recently there was a change that forced you to use a buffer account to share to social networks such as facebook
0_1809	0	a	seems kind of pointless for those who dont have a buffer account nor want one to have to create an account and have it be the middleman between feedly and facebook
0_1810	0	a	i loved the way facebook sharing was
0_1811	0	a	clean at the end of articles and available for comments before posting
0_1812	0	a	if it aint broke dont fix it
0_1813	0	a	feedly allowed mailing articles through gmail directly instead of bringing up a mail client
0_1814	1	a	i want that feature back as i would like to mail my articles directly
0_1815	0	a	the g hack does not work for mailing lists
0_1816	1	a	when i tag an article in feedly i want the tags to follow when i export the article to evernote with the built in evernote feature for feedly pro plan
0_1817	0	a	as it is now when i export with the evernotebutton an article i have to manually log in to evernote and ad the tag again
0_1818	1	a	it would be nice if we were able to view content from twitter embeds such as images in feedly
0_1819	0	a	some libsyn feeds dont link to the libsyn item but rather the audio file directly
0_1820	0	a	you used to be able to right click on the item in feedly and save it
0_1821	0	a	now you have to open the file and use save page as
0_1822	0	a	please fix this
0_1823	0	a	beeline reader full disclosure i am the founder has browser plugins that apply eyeguiding color gradients to make reading faster and easier
0_1824	0	a	over of people find that these gradients improve readability and the plugins work great on feedly
0_1825	1	a	but the beeline functionality could be built into the feedly ui using the beeline javascript library
0_1826	1	a	add google as option for feed that appear on the left in the app and also in your main feed
0_1827	0	a	when we longpress on a link in feedly or in a web view were given the option to add it to reading list but not to instapaper or any of the other read later services
0_1828	1	a	when you select a preferred rl service it should also be available when you longpress a link so that you can send that link directly to your favorite service rather than having to open the link wait for it to load then send it to instapaper or pocket or whatever you prefer
0_1829	0	a	i have searched high and low google duckduckgo feedlycom which redirects me to my feeds from where there are no other links pimpmysafari dead link apples safari extension gallery everywhere
0_1830	0	a	i see people talking about the extension all over the place but for the life of me i cannot locate a link to the damn thing
0_1832	0	a	the abillity to export an article or post directly to kindle orand other ebook readers
0_1833	0	a	in the firefox extension selecting oldest first under change layout doesnt stick
0_1834	0	a	it keeps resetting to unchecked so the sort is newest first the next time you enter that category
0_1835	1	a	import google current feeds into feedly
0_1836	1	a	add ability to share whole articles to evernote
0_1837	0	a	this option is very important when rss feed contains only text excerpt
0_1838	1	a	make feedly more sandboxed
0_1839	0	a	android feedly chrome
0_1840	0	a	i have a chrome icon in the action bar
0_1841	0	a	i think its for open in browser or maybe share with chrome
0_1842	1	a	anyway itd be great if this opened the currently visible article in the browser instead of the previous article
0_1843	0	a	thats how it used to work and i think that makes more sense
0_1844	0	a	sometimes after ive clicked into an articleinto a chrome taband then clicked the back button i end up at the feedly apps top level rather than at the article summary
0_1845	0	a	im presented with the feedly apps splash screen along the way
0_1846	0	a	as is one has to open each post one wants to read later
0_1847	0	a	often i have little time and just want to scan headlines and make sure the ones that seem important get into the readitlater pile
0_1848	1	a	unify login feedly allowing access by more than one source or facebook or google or microsoft or
0_1849	0	a	just depending on what the user decided accounts relate
0_1850	1	a	i would like the feedly chrome app to act just like the google reader one shows how many feeds i have and i can click on them individually
0_1851	1	a	add the number of followers to your subscribe button like bloglovin already does to be displayed on blogs
0_1852	1	a	provide the html code with your other buttons
0_1853	1	a	integrate twitter cards on article preview page so that when viewing an article that has an embedded twitter card with all its information it shows the card instead of plain text
0_1854	0	a	when i save an article to evernote the resulting note is the text and images but not what the webpage looks like
0_1855	1	a	the evernote web clipper allows to me save the full page but i would love to be able to do this straight from feedly
0_1856	0	a	i currently use pocket as my read later app but was hoping to move to evernote
0_1857	1	a	right now it takes clicks and navigating to another tab for saving to pocket it would be nice if its handled in the same window with popup or just with single click
0_1858	1	a	also if its possible to override save for later to pocket
0_1859	1	a	id like to have feedly integrate with bitly
0_1860	1	a	bitlys bookmark function combined with its url shortener and usage information would be really useful when sharing from feedly
0_1861	1	a	please allow chrome feedly and other browsers feedly to customize favourite saving tool so that i can save to pocket with one click and please also cut the settings on the pockets end for adding a new item
0_1862	0	a	would be most appreciated
0_1864	0	a	i currently use gread widget to see my unread count on google reader
0_1865	0	a	its how i get notified that there is unread items while i am on the mac
0_1866	1	a	essentially id like to see the ability to add all to an external application such as desktop ticker by mike batt
0_1867	0	a	this application and greader pro for android is where i pull all my news in normally and desktop ticker is now useless as of this morning without a way to pull feedly or digg reader
0_1868	0	a	might have to check to see if they have its data into it
0_1869	0	a	i like the feedly interface more than the instapaper interface
0_1870	1	a	i would like to read my instapaper saved articles via feedly
0_1871	0	a	we use feedly and the buffer link in a work environment
0_1872	0	a	i have googled and found at the moment feedly only works on one web browser which is google chrome
0_1873	0	a	we are limited to one browser which is internet explorer in our work environment so we are currently unable to use your services
0_1874	1	a	please can you give us a fix or enable your program to work in ie
0_1875	0	a	other users who are using your program for work purposes will have a similar problem as it makes it difficult for it teams to support more than one browser
0_1876	1	a	id like to be able to save articles to mindsky similar to other integrations
0_1877	0	a	as available with their save tool
0_1878	0	a	its frustrating that i dont need to remember passwords anymore when i am using safari but i need to exit feedly go to settings safaripasswordslook for the sitecopy passwordgo to feedly again and paste password
0_1879	1	a	apply the awesome mobile app feature to the web interface
0_1880	1	a	i would love to be able to save directly to pocket like i can on the android app
0_1881	0	a	all is in title
0_1882	1	a	when a term is added should lookup for feeds in popular rss feed directories in one go
0_1883	0	a	this will present with more options to subscribe to
0_1884	0	a	as a web developer i do not like plugins that add elements to the dom of each page
0_1885	1	a	can you use a traditional address bar button
0_1886	0	a	simple timeline were you can add content from twitteraccounts facebook sitesprofiles in a own categorie
0_1887	0	a	im working on a feedly application and i want to add some pro features like instream search but i am not able to test these because i dont have a pro account
0_1888	1	a	so my suggestion is to offer developers a switch to turn onoff pro features in the sandbox
0_1889	0	a	obviously this should be somehow restricted so that this system cant be abused
0_1890	0	a	feedly always inserts quotation marks in posts to buffer
0_1891	1	a	please remove the quotation marks or make buffer post template editable like already the twitter post template
0_1893	0	a	the use case is that i am surfing the web and i find a site that id like to follow
0_1894	1	a	i drag the url to my feedly bookmark and feedly adds the feed to my account even better would be the ability to categorize the feed as i add it
0_1895	0	a	the ability to let indigo read the title of the posts perhaps with commands to marks as unread save even read the whole article like an interactive radio
0_1896	0	a	you recently added function and allowed us to save an article to evernote thats great
0_1897	0	a	however evernotes service for china is not supported
0_1898	1	a	please do not abandon market in china
0_1899	1	a	please remove google requirement
0_1900	1	a	it would be great if chrome and opera werent the only options for opening up articles in
0_1901	0	a	im using your chrome app
0_1902	0	a	due to the way your article popup is positioned its close button sits directly above the side pane
0_1903	0	a	although my mouse click is properly sent to the close button any mouse movement after the popup goes away is sent to the side pane which causes it to intelligently expand and reflow the list of articles that i am trying to read
0_1904	0	a	its really annoying
0_1905	0	a	i really love how i can browse the latest articles from all feeds on the ios version but this doesnt seem to be an option on the chrome web app version
0_1906	0	a	i might just not be able to find the option so if someone else has anything to add then please comment
0_1907	0	a	keep the awesome work up guys
0_1908	1	a	at some point can we get google keep integration to go along side pocket
0_1909	0	a	that is if they have an api for it
0_1910	0	a	i have a jabberaccount googletalk
0_1911	1	a	i would like to receive the headlines as items arrive to my imclient
0_1912	0	a	as soon as i log in online your jabberbot could return to looking as defined in the settings of fresh news headlines
0_1913	0	a	if i am already connected the bot could write headlines with links to me upon receipt of the news in my rsssubscription
0_1914	0	a	my facebook page is blocked by the plugin
0_1915	0	a	i uninstalled all plugins and i only reactivated the feedly plugin to be sure
0_1916	1	a	if i have a feed in a folder named cooking i would like the ifttt ingredient entitled articlecategories to return cooking
0_1917	0	a	currently it returns nothing
0_1918	1	a	please make an app for blackberry playbook because there are no apps that support feedly on blackberry app world for playbook
0_1919	0	a	this would make integration with other stuff eg newsbeuter possible
0_1920	0	a	this could make the feedly opml a canonical source of feeds for other apps that a user wants to use
0_1921	1	a	reset the rss subscribe function after someone uninstalls your extension
0_1922	0	a	the current uninstall leaves several settings in your about config and makes other changes which make it impossible to subscribe using live bookmarks anymore
0_1923	0	a	ive had to switch back to feedly just so i can subscribe to new feeds
0_1925	0	a	for me it actually provides a worse experience than the builtin browser it brings chrome to the foreground and opens the link i tapped in a new tab
0_1926	0	a	to get back to feedly i have to back out or go into recent apps
0_1927	1	a	what i want is to be able to skim through my feed items and quickly open n tabs in the background then go to my browser and read through them at my leisure
0_1928	1	a	having tap always open a foreground tab is okay but probably better to be configurable
0_1929	1	a	however if in articletitle view allow long press to bring up a menu
0_1930	0	a	open in new external browser tab
0_1931	1	a	at least allow configuring the action for long press
0_1932	0	a	a lot of the rss feeds i read force you to go to the full site to read the full article
0_1933	0	a	lifehacker is a good example
0_1934	1	a	one thing that would be nice is the ability to be able to hit one button to open all of the unread articles for a category in new browser tabs rather than having to click each one separately
0_1935	1	a	it would be nice to have a similar feature on mobile except the way it would work would be to add all of the articles to pocket or an alternative readitlater app pocket all or something like that
0_1936	0	a	if i want to subscribe to tumblr blog assume rss at the end of a link i paste i now have to manually add rss to links like to subscribe
0_1937	0	a	the good read tagline isnt attached to my twitter posts when i schedule the posts through buffer
0_1938	1	a	please add this feature
0_1939	1	a	make it possible to link an article to your facebook business page
0_1940	1	a	right now feedly isnt consistantly running across browser this needs to be investigated and fixed
0_1941	0	a	i work which adivertisement so i like to seeing new video ideas but when i try to see vevo video on the feedly i never can only youtube videos
0_1942	0	a	im constantly missing important content that happens in google as i dont check it regularly
0_1943	0	a	the unfortunate thing about this is that if i had an rss feed id include it in feedly but google does not offer this
0_1944	1	a	it would be great if there was a way to see all of the content id see in google via the api and present it in feedly
0_1945	1	a	being able to add a click feed for facebook would also be quite useful
0_1946	0	a	i have noticed that it is difficult to add new blogs that i want to follow including my own
0_1947	0	a	when i search for emi ito illustration or the website wwwemiitoillustrationcom nothing comes up
0_1948	0	a	this is the case even when i have subscribed to the blog through feedly through the feedly button on my blog
0_1950	1	a	would be cool if i could view the basecamp progress feed in feedly
0_1951	0	a	i use the saved items while on mobile to flag items for review on pc
0_1952	1	a	it would be nice to have an indicator on the chrome extension icon to remind me if i have saved items to review
0_1953	1	a	i need huffduffer integration to send selected audiofiles from within my rssfeeds to this service
0_1954	0	a	worked perfectly in google reader
0_1955	0	a	depends on connections and permits their are not just one profile related posts
0_1956	0	a	it requires an integration with google api perhaps even cooperate with google to make this specific data accessible
0_1957	0	a	ie version
0_1958	0	a	with ie and later in windows and windows you can drag a web site url from the address bar to the taskbar and pin the site to your taskbar for easy access
0_1959	0	a	this makes for quick access to the site
0_1960	0	a	imo it also helps with the brand of the site as the app is front and center for the user and feels like any other application
0_1961	0	a	web sites like tweetdeck pandora facebook bing etc all include this functionality
0_1962	0	a	most even incorporate jump lists into the pinned site icon
0_1963	1	a	when viewing feeds from dribbblecom i would like to have a like button that is integrated with the like mechanisms from their site
0_1964	0	a	when browsing a site with rss and atom metadata header the chroma and firefox plugin presents a transparent button to quickly and easily allow you to add this feed to feedly
0_1965	1	a	could the same be added to safari
0_1966	0	a	having a popup window open is pretty clunky
0_1967	1	a	should just be able to click the icon and assuming the account link is activesignedin send to readability
0_1968	1	a	it would be really helpfull to have a feature of that shortens articles like summly or wavii
0_1969	0	a	furthermore itll have to be compatible with any rss feed i have in my list
0_1970	0	a	for that kind of feature compared with the already existing and wonderfull feedly i would love to pay because it makes my reading faster
0_1971	0	a	recently the visit website launches the internal browser but it fails to load anything
0_1972	0	a	you can launch safari from the internal button but then you have to bounce back and forth between apps
0_1973	0	a	this works fine on the iphone but not on ipad
0_1974	0	a	so i am using url for recent uploads from a youtube account example
0_1975	0	a	the page from the url loads fine and shows recent uploads but subscribing to that url in feedly is missing out some videos for example i cant see video europa universalis iv common sense multiplayer on the feed
0_1976	0	a	it was uploaded yesterday thought feedly shows some videos before it and after it why that one is missing
0_1977	0	a	not sure if thats youtube only related spotted it with yt
0_1978	0	a	thats really bad though we might be missing some random content and noone would know about it
0_1979	1	a	please use feedly users rather than googles users
0_1980	1	a	i suggest a feedly to google calendar feature
0_1981	1	a	i saw a tv preview for a show next week and i want to be reminded regarding this feed entry
0_1982	1	a	it will be great if you will develop a windows software for those who would like to read their feed on the computer
0_1983	1	a	or at least make the browser extension useful firefox addon has no use
0_1984	1	a	i want a one stop shop for all of these aspects of my internet life
0_1985	0	a	it would also mean that i dont have to try and search for the video channels i am subscribed to on youtube within feedly
0_1986	0	a	i just click subscribe and they appear in my feedly
0_1987	0	a	same for tumblr twitter and facebook
0_1988	0	a	something similar to flipboards functionality except your feed reader is immensely better than theirs
0_1989	1	a	id like to plug feedly into macs rss screensaver but believe there is no way to do it
0_1990	1	a	i would like to be able to thumbs up or down videos from my youtube feeds from within feedly
0_1991	1	a	also allow a youtube video to continue to play while i scroll through the rest of my feeds
0_1992	1	a	please add evernote support to the iphone for pro users
0_1993	0	a	why was it necessary for us all to have
0_1994	0	a	cloud version but no option or explanation at any time that all my feeds have gone
0_1995	0	a	first of all i love feedly
0_1996	1	a	id like to suggest reverting the change that was made in last version regarding the safari browser stuff
0_1997	0	a	i use my phone with left hand and feedly was great thumb would scroll swipe touch to open articles
0_1998	0	a	once in the article whether within feedly or in safari i would press the back button top left
0_1999	0	a	now the change has me reaching top right for the done button
0_2000	0	a	disappointing from a ux perspective cause before it was perfect and seemless gets worse with bigger phones of course
0_2001	0	a	i use evernote to store all of my note and picture from web pages
0_2002	1	a	it would be great to have some integration with that app
0_2003	1	a	feedly v fails to post to twitter from ios needs to be fixed
0_2004	0	a	the share icon can prevent a user to click on something behind even if its a small icon
0_2005	0	a	and i play some times with javascript and its influence by my script but in the extension bar it wont bother my script anymore
0_2006	0	a	same for debugging webpage
0_2007	1	a	and or you can make it a keyboard shortcuts
0_2008	1	a	integration with offline translatordictionary is highly needed such as goldendict just add an icon to open the dictionary when pointing to a word in an artical
0_2009	0	a	to view the full article via the visit website or by clicking the title freezes the loading of the page within feedly browser
0_2010	1	a	add ui element ao shortcut to quickly add reference to default evernote folder wt popup dialog or confirmation
0_2011	0	a	hi i really enjoy using feedly nextgen on windows phone and was excited to see the workflow with onenote which i already use for all my other note taking
0_2012	0	a	however it seems that the selection of where to save any given article to onenote on windows phone always uses the default section set in onenote and not the one specified in the path when activating my onenote account
0_2013	0	a	i am running windows phone lumia denim on a nokia lumia with nextgen reader
0_2014	0	a	api connectivity to all google apps for work
0_2015	0	a	add read later to the desktop extensions
0_2016	1	a	i just wish i could archive and group or send to another read later app from there to organize
0_2017	0	a	ive been a fan of feedly but am now losing heart
0_2018	0	a	ive updated my ipad and now cant use feedly with buffer at all
0_2019	0	a	ive tried deleting apps and different configuration but impossible
0_2020	1	a	why dont you test your blasted products before launching changes
0_2021	0	a	you alienate your users and then impossible to get any sort of service to fix the problem
0_2022	0	a	to import an opml file still shows a link to but the link is redirecting
0_2023	0	a	so prey make it clear that this functionality does not exist or tell us how to import a and opml list
0_2024	0	a	when i visit certain oggbased podcast feeds such as the embedded player shows as a video rather than an audio player and the player controls do not work
0_2025	0	a	in order to listen to the podcast i have to open the ogg file in a new tab and use the firefox embedded plater
0_2026	1	a	need support to add articles in pocket directly
0_2027	0	a	this can be added alongside twitter google and other buttons
0_2028	1	a	like many others i want to add some twitter feeds as rss feeds
0_2029	0	a	there are several older threads on this issue with some suggestions that no longer seem to work
0_2030	1	a	to feedly can you please provide this type of service perhaps within you pro account if there are extra overheads
0_2031	1	a	and can you please make the formatting support direct linking from the urls embedded in the tweets
0_2032	1	a	it would be good to not have to link to twitter to get a usable url
0_2033	1	a	currently i use a workaround but it would be nice to have this feature in feedly
0_2034	0	a	im wondering what the latest solutions people are using to read twitter feeds in feedly
0_2035	0	a	when techbargaincom updated their site it no longer worked with feedly
0_2036	0	a	i use google auth for both pocket and for feedly
0_2037	0	a	i can log in to feedly that works fine
0_2038	0	a	i chose pocket as my preferred saving tool
0_2039	0	a	when i try to save to pocket though i get please configure
0_2040	0	a	in the pocket settings i only seem to have the ability to set a pocket username and password
0_2041	0	a	i cant find any way to configure pocket to use google auth
0_2042	0	a	is it possible to use google auth to save to pocket from feedly on android
0_2043	1	a	i want to be able to just log into feedly and not have it log me out if i log out of google
0_2044	1	a	bring back tap saving to pocket in ios apps
0_2045	0	a	when i use the define option in ios in ipad deeply opens a new window instead of showing a pop up
0_2046	0	a	opening the word definition ins new windows does not make sense specially in an ipad
0_2047	0	a	safari seems to have broken the toolbar
0_2048	0	a	is that going to be fixed
0_2049	0	a	hi i go smoothly feedly web version and android but windows desktop not mobile i do not get i log
0_2050	0	a	i tried with kara and nextgen reader reader
0_2051	1	a	please dont open a browser every time i want to share a post to my social networks google facebook
0_2052	0	a	flipboard has a awesome way of doing it but your rss management is far better
0_2053	1	a	please add wiznote support as you support evernote
0_2054	0	a	hasnt been updating craiglist feeds for awhile even though outlook and ighome are updating those same feeds
0_2055	1	a	the rss markup of these feeds identifies the author eg dccreator use that to set the author attribute for the evernote note
0_2056	1	a	if author isnt available than set author to name of the site or blog
0_2057	0	a	when using feedly on a mobile device location information becomes available to the app as well
0_2058	1	a	could feedly also set these note attributes when exporting to evernote
0_2059	1	a	perhaps other additional attributes
0_2060	0	a	tags could be good and bad depending on how a user uses evernote
0_2061	1	a	that being said exporting tags as well could be a master setting someone could toggle on or off basically improving the depth of integration with evernote
0_2062	0	a	currently feedly syncs with google reader
0_2063	1	a	since google reader is going away on july st i think it would be an awesome if feedly syncs with theoldreader it would be a great partnership for both of you
0_2064	0	a	i just noticed that when i tried to view an rss feed from blogspot it automatically prompted feedly to show the feed
0_2065	0	a	im a web developer and i just wanted to copy the url of the feed
0_2066	0	a	is there a way to toggle this automatic feature
0_2067	0	a	if not can you offer it
0_2068	1	a	add integration with toodledo
0_2069	1	a	the new feedly ios ipad app integration with safari is fantastic but please allow a simple left to right swipe to take you from an article you have finished reading in safari back into feedly instead of having to use done at the top of the safari browser
0_2070	0	a	i think my subject says it all
0_2071	0	a	my hypothesis what people read is important for a prospective employer
0_2072	1	a	a list of my rss feeds should be available as a public shareable list that i can attach to a cover letter and let the company i interview for create a better picture as a person
0_2073	0	a	same as an integration for linkedin
0_2074	0	a	not individual articles list as a whole
0_2075	0	a	think group list on linkedin
0_2076	1	a	allow to pin things to pinterest
0_2077	1	a	if i could add individual users as a feed then i could see their updates without having to scroll through facebooks ridiculous wall
0_2078	0	a	the same for twitter
0_2079	1	a	just being able to add a twitter account and view only a single users tweets would easily make feedly one of the best twitter platforms there is
0_2080	1	a	please prevent duplicate saved items in dropbox
0_2081	0	a	for feedly pro users when a pdf is generated for depositing in dropbox for later reading that you offer an option for whether bookmarks are autogenerated inside feedlys pdf
0_2082	0	a	adobe acrobat doesnt allow the user to set an option to permahide the bookmarks pane and i guestimate that of the pdfs feedly pro generates only have one bookmark the article title
0_2083	0	a	its annoying to have acrobat autoopen a useless bookmark listing one entry in the reading window because it decreases the visible screen real estate devoted to rendering the pdf
0_2084	0	a	this is way more adobes ui problem than yours
0_2085	0	a	feedly to google plus causes the feedly app to crash back to the home screen on kindle fire
0_2086	0	a	pointemy domain to feedly
0_2087	0	a	visitors can see wwwdomaincom
0_2088	1	a	when we want to email news or feed records feedly do it via outlook it is better to send it via gmail or make an option for it
0_2089	1	a	i use rockmelt as browser and feedly wont load he loads just fine in google chrome but i would like to be able to use it with rockmel
0_2090	1	a	i would like to be able to send articles to clipboardcom
0_2091	0	a	right now when you has x news articles and when you read them by scrolling for ex and then click refresh when no new articles badge not disappear it remain with x
0_2092	0	a	why the need access to data on all websites
0_2093	0	a	this item can read every page that you visit your bank your web email your facebook page and so on
0_2094	0	a	often this kind of item needs to see all pages so that it can perform a limited task such as looking for rss feeds that you might want to subscribe to
0_2096	0	a	two problems i have to click twice on a youtube video to be played
0_2097	0	a	after the first click the actual video shows up in a smaller region
0_2098	0	a	for solid userssharing often categories are organized by prioritytier or other purpose not what makes most sense for social sharing and assigning tags to a specific feed
0_2099	0	a	this drives me crazy and feels like an invasion of privacy
0_2100	0	a	is there any way to undo this
0_2101	0	a	each time i use the chrome app it asks to connect to google reader
0_2102	0	a	i press connect allow it and it doesnt load the feeds just returns to the same login page
0_2103	0	a	i just reinstalled firefox on a new machine and i cant login to feedly via google authentication
0_2104	0	a	it works fine with chrome ie but when i click the login link in firefox nothing happens
0_2105	1	a	include outsidethenestnet please
0_2106	0	a	at work i received an alert from feedly that i needed to update to v of the plugin
0_2107	0	a	when i get home i see that my home system is running v but i cant get to feedlycom regardless of what i do because the plugin knows better than me
0_2108	0	a	even after i log out of feedly
0_2109	0	a	i have toy disable the extension
0_2110	1	a	please make it possible to go to feedlycom or make it possible to download an update from within the extension
0_2111	0	a	hi i am not sure where i can claim problems
0_2112	0	a	the feedly app is showing me an error since a couple of days
0_2113	0	a	it is equal if i use my ipad or my iphone different provider sim cards both are showing me the error that no connection is there
0_2114	0	a	after that i downloaded other feedly apps like ziner they work without any problem
0_2115	0	a	what can i do
0_2116	1	a	i wish to connect feedy with social networks youtube vimeo tumblr instagram to synchronize the news and our favorites
0_2117	0	a	when can we command feedly through our voice
0_2118	0	a	this will be an excellent advantage compared with other options
0_2119	0	a	yes your are right too similar to her the movie
0_2120	0	a	but i think its necessary
0_2121	0	a	come on guys twitter is winning the battle for far
0_2122	0	a	i want feedly to be bigger
0_2123	0	a	feedly mini is very nice plugin for me
0_2124	0	a	but the feedly mini icon is not shown on the naver blog such as or
0_2125	0	a	when you tap the pocket or instapaper icon there isnt much of a visual induction that the article has been saved
0_2126	1	a	also would be nice to be able to send an article to pocket from the list view without having to open the article
0_2127	1	a	swiping the title would be a good solution
0_2128	1	a	when i open a feed within the internal browser and it does load the full webpage id like to share it via email client having it imported as it is just as a reference under win using another feed reader feedlyenabled and opening the mail app it does import the page so i can mail it out as it is or if you like as if i sent it to onenote or evernote as simple article
0_2129	0	a	just as a reference under win using another feed reader feedlyenabled and opening the mail app it does import the page so i can mail it out as it is or if you like as if i sent it to onenote or evernote as simple article
0_2130	0	a	i am not sure if this is due to feedly app limitation or something else
0_2131	0	a	but textonly imports with just a link as i come up with with gmail app is poor
0_2132	0	a	i started using a new chrome app called hacker vision
0_2133	0	a	if flips the screen resolution so most webages have a dark back ground and fonts are light colors
0_2134	0	a	it is supposed to be easier on your eyes
0_2135	0	a	so far i am liking it but the colors are sometimes off
0_2136	0	a	what i have noticed is that the feedly mini toolbar that pops up on the bottom right of web pages when i want to share the link via that mini feedly toolbar the background color and the color of the icons twitter buffer etc are all the same color
0_2137	0	a	any way you can fix this
0_2138	0	a	is this a problem that hacker vision needs to address
0_2139	0	a	please advise
0_2140	0	a	feedly is really bad at discovering feeds when given only the url
0_2141	0	a	google reader used to be able to do this with pretty much every url you threw at it and it doesnt seem to be terribly complicated
0_2142	0	a	giving this url to feedly returns no feeds
0_2143	0	a	however if you manually google what the standard format for feeds is with wordpress and try out
0_2144	0	a	which seems like something that feedly might have been able to guess to begin with
0_2145	0	a	i had to turn off the windows tray app
0_2146	0	a	chrome would gradually get slower and slower a new development since feedly asked to run the alwayson tray app
0_2147	0	a	im sure its the app because exiting it cleared up all the browser response problems
0_2148	1	a	either fix it or make feedly work alwayson without browser interference
0_2149	0	a	not much else to sayinclude an icon for flipboard
0_2150	0	a	integration with other social media so i can read all the latest tweets google updates and others from with the feedly app
0_2151	0	a	you have a group of friends with send my favorite post writing command
0_2152	0	a	currently some of the rss items are lists of links
0_2153	0	a	expected behavior when i follow one of the links find it interesting and click the pocket icon is to save the clickedthrough article
0_2154	0	a	instead it saves the initial rss item
0_2155	0	a	take mike tysons channel for example
0_2156	0	a	that string ucdtnjowfqpgvkfyoelyzrg or any channel like that doesnt work with feedly
0_2157	1	a	you have to go in and get the rss via please automate this
0_2159	0	a	i created a few ideas in the get satisfaction community dont remember how i got there and was very surprised never to get an answer until i realized you guys worked in user voice
0_2160	0	a	there appears to be a current bug with the android app and the evernote integration
0_2161	0	a	for about the last week when i try to save it forces me to relogin to evernote
0_2162	0	a	this is one of my primary use flows and a big bummer as i use two factor authentication on evernote
0_2163	0	a	i noticed several of my facebook pages werent updating and then saw this announcement that facebook has stopped updating rss feeds
0_2164	0	a	the few that i follow are for ones where no website exists for them
0_2165	0	a	i love feedly for following them please find a way
0_2166	0	a	hey i have feedly notifier in firefox on windows
0_2167	0	a	when i click the icon it just says no unread articles where it used to show lots of articles i could open in new tabs
912_2	0	a	as it occurs on android and ios
912_3	0	a	i cannot for example highlight a friend when i am trying to tell something to him in my post
912_4	0	a	second why dont work with metro style on fb app
912_5	0	a	why this common and ridiculous traditional facebook style
913_1	1	a	why microsoft doesnt close this vacuum spaces this things it really needs
913_2	0	a	the rotation style of metro will be awesome
913_3	0	a	i remember in the beginning the fb works with this pattern and unfortunately you abandoned
915_1	0	a	when using internet explorer in windows phone on nokia lumia os i noticed that pointing to specific section of any document using name doesnt work from pages using frameset doctype is correctly set to html supporting framesets
915_2	0	a	to verify try clicking on any method in java javadoc for example open and click through javaapplet appletcontext getapplet
915_3	0	a	java site uses brackets in links names which is not ok but this is not related to this issue and even links without brackets dont work
915_4	1	a	trial feature should be builtin with autoprompted and disabling just like the windows store
916_1	0	a	if the user uninstalls during a trial if even tracks this fact and prevents them from starting a new trial later
916_2	1	a	contract this with the windows phone world where we tell you we want trial mode but we have to track the number of days since install whether the user has purchased etc
916_3	0	a	if the user uninstalls and installs again later we have no idea
917_1	0	a	for an app that doesnt require a login so theres no account to tie the usage to and doesnt have a natural way to limit functionality adding a trialmode feels like implementandpray
917_2	0	a	with the two stores combining can we bring this to windows phone
917_3	0	a	contract this with the windows phone world where we tell you we want trial mode but we have to track the number of days since install whether the user has purchased more
917_4	0	a	you can only select text as big as screen
917_5	0	a	if larger it doesnt scroll down so you can only select part of the text
917_6	0	a	if ios and android can do it why cant windows phone
917_7	0	a	like all the timer apps on android ios they can update the badge numbers real time giving you a true countdown timer experience
917_8	0	a	why cant windows phone do this
917_9	0	a	it should be able to do this
917_10	0	a	would battery experience really degrade that much
917_11	0	a	if so me thinks this is a fundamental flaw in the os
917_12	0	a	is it possible to get a flash player for wp or silverlight for wp more and more websites doesnt work by video clips
917_13	1	a	there need to be a business app settings launcher native in the api
917_14	1	a	on my whats new panel in contacts i want to see posts from facebook from people that are subscribed followed and not for all friends
918_1	0	a	i have wpx
919_1	0	a	probably in wpx its fixed
919_2	0	a	please give me info
919_4	0	a	the rss section does not seem to work when the app is installed
919_5	0	a	the phone can reach the xml file and it does work in the preview in the app studio
919_6	1	a	remove the lock screen and make it a notifications screen
919_7	0	a	want to add an image like radar cloud layer drone image etc to a phone map and have it scale relative to the zoom layer
919_8	0	a	our app requires to call a web service from the applicationdeactivatedapplicationclosing event to generate an analytics report
919_9	0	a	currently windows phone does not allow to call a webservice from these events
919_10	0	a	now that beta apps do not expire we the developers need a way to force remove a beta app from devices or remove access for certain users
919_11	1	a	please provide us a way via the dev center to force the expiration of the beta app for all or for certain users
919_12	0	a	when i turn off the settingscreen autorotationi find that this function is still enable in the settingabout phone
919_13	0	a	since many devs these days use consider only webkit while developing mobile websites these websites do not render good using iewhich uses trident isnt much html compliant
920_1	0	a	it degrades browsing quality and i am unable to create a new browser which can fix this issue
920_2	0	a	uc browser and ie are already there but they use trident and are hopeless while browsing most of the websites that use vendor specific prefixes and nonstandard code
920_3	0	a	antutu results show and score only d graphics and the whole system as it is all d gets rendered really well and almost lagfree
921_1	0	a	apart from these a game like asphalt has almost the same lag as minion rush does while those two are quite much different
921_2	0	a	from these i concluded that a big part of d rendering might be a burden upon cpu while gpu does not do much
921_3	0	a	is that right
921_4	1	a	add podcasts as new data resource in windows phone studio app website
922_1	1	a	there should be mechanism that code can read installed apps
922_2	0	a	change country on dev center account
922_3	0	a	cant believe this isnt possible
922_4	1	a	if you wont let me change the country at least let me close my account and recreate it
923_1	0	a	a simple component and plugin can be design to bring forth data to windows phone from our web pages rather on wordpress or joomla instead of using rss feeds
924_1	1	a	popular forums like kuenna for joomla and stand alone forums should be allowed
924_2	1	a	user and passwords sync should be allowed as well for participation
925_1	1	a	add coloured backgrounds
925_2	1	a	id like to feed crash reports straight into my bug tracker
926_1	0	a	right now theres no easy way to automate their download and parsing
926_2	1	a	an httpbased api with a programfriendly logon exampleoauth would be most welcome
926_3	0	a	i love one note because of its fast cross platform sync i feel when i am on a call and want to take notes adding a button in the dialer loudspeaker mute hold add call to open onenote will help me open it easily
926_4	0	a	when it is opened from a call then onenote can get information on the call details person who is on call time etc which would enable easier understanding
926_5	0	a	similarly this idea could be thought through for integration of one note with other native applications like camera messaging etc
926_6	1	a	i want to be able to control the balance of the audio i play back with the backgroundaudioplayer
926_7	1	a	there is no good reason for not allowing this so please add it
926_8	1	a	allow microsoftphonescheduledtask
926_9	1	a	start at the specified time
926_11	0	a	facing problem while i open my app
926_12	0	a	it opens ad then close
926_16	0	a	the build in wp longlistselector will jump to the last item added when data loading
926_17	0	a	when used in combination with mvvm and sorted data this will result in the fact that the lls is positioned at the bottom of the list when all data is available
926_18	0	a	we now need to add extra code to reposition it at the top after it has been loaded
926_19	1	a	please provide a property to enabledisable this feature
926_20	1	a	in my application some data required to save on disk there is limited storage in phone memory i just need api to write or create files folder wise on external memory like memory card
926_21	1	a	add right to left orientation for text and pages support in windows phone studio app website
927_1	1	a	please allow us developers to access two dimensional array of bytes from the picture that is within the image control
927_2	0	a	this would provide much powerful photo apps for real time shutting and photo editing
927_3	1	a	i want to have access to all single bytes within picture so i can do with those bytes whatever i want
927_4	0	a	poder guardar aplicaciones en skydrive y poder ejecutarlas seria una funcin nica de los windows phone
927_5	0	a	ejecutarlas a pesar de no tener conexin a una red
927_6	0	a	native video player and support for subtitle if i am right the native video player doesnt support subtitle file srt
927_7	0	a	it would be real help in increasing user experience
927_8	0	a	it is a common scenario for the user to initiate a network transfer then turn off the screen or switch to another app while the transfer is still in progress
927_9	1	a	apps should get at least seconds of background processing time to complete such network transfers and process the response
927_10	0	a	im aware that the background transfer service is available but there are cases where this is not usable because it requires the data to be transferred to be written to temporary files in the storage
927_11	0	a	this is also a capability that other mobile platforms have and i think it is needed to build quality apps with a good user experience
928_1	0	a	i completely understand the need for restrictions on background processing to help preserve battery life and responsiveness but windows phone is currently too restrictive
928_2	0	a	this is also a capability that other mobile platforms have and i think it is more
929_1	1	a	it would be very useful to be able to prepair a mmscomposetask in the same way that we today could use the smscomposetask
930_1	0	a	being able to prepare an mms for the user would have many usages and the functionality are readily available on other platforms
931_1	1	a	it would be really good to add parallel linq in windows phone and portable class libraries for collection processing unification and efficiency
931_2	0	a	ssh ssl and some other protocols for vpn tuneling whole device we need
931_3	0	a	the lowend phone with less storage but with the sd are really diffused but the limit of the data that cant be stored in sd is awful
932_1	0	a	with the app on sd the device can be better
932_2	1	a	make ussd codes running on windows phone with os version
933_1	0	a	to use the search button for any application in order to avoir to add everytime a custom search functionality
935_1	0	a	when a phone is reset or replaced restoration o installed apps in quite cumbersome
936_1	1	a	the store lists purchase history but a reinstallation must be done one by one and b the list doesnt indicate which apps have been removed eg
937_2	1	a	would be cool to have an app or even better a command in the store app that saves a list of currently installed apps after each install uninstall so that the user can reinstall all the apps as easily as updating of a number of apps takes place now
938_1	0	a	after finishing the callit doesnt show the call history about how much time it we talked
938_2	0	a	in the dashboard when you are uploading images in the app description it does not work for me as i am sure theres a timeout implemented in the uploading code
939_1	0	a	i can upload the smaller promotional images fine but the larger sceenshot pngs will not upload
939_2	0	a	yes my internet upload speed is slow but the site should function for slow upload speeds also why not
939_3	0	a	the same goes for the app uploading itself a larger timeout is there but there is still a timeout that assumes a reasonably fast upload speed which not everyone has
939_4	0	a	everyone in the usa has nice upload speeds possibly but not worldwide and i presume microsoft would wish to enable developers from other countries also to be able to use their dev center
939_5	1	a	just remove the timeouts completely or at least increase all timeouts by a factor of at least its not a big deal to implement
939_6	0	a	everyone in the usa has more
939_7	0	a	the reminder function in the wp calendar must be expand to more weekly options
939_8	0	a	week weeks weeks weeks up to weeks from a selected day
940_1	0	a	i hope you understand me
940_2	0	a	im german and my english is not so good
940_3	0	a	my problem is i can use any calendar app but the function goes back to the base calendar
940_4	0	a	often i have to make dates that returns weeks on friday or two weeks on wednesday
941_1	0	a	in my old android calendar is it no problem but in my wp is it not possible
941_2	0	a	best regards and a happy new year karsten klein from germany the reminder function in the wp calendar must be expand to more weekly options
941_3	0	a	best regards and a more
941_4	0	a	a shared key chain to share data between the apps this help in apps with features like sso
941_5	0	a	invariably some users resort to posting negative reviews which actually are questions to the developer that the developer can not answer directly because of the way nature of the reviews
941_6	1	a	i would like to see a simple change to the rate and review page near the bottom
942_1	1	a	just add a small text blurb like if you are experiencing problems with this application please consider sending feedback instead along with a link to launch an email to the support email address
943_1	1	a	to go step further making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support system
943_2	0	a	set up a brokerage system whereby the developer never sees the users live email address and instead replies to a proxy email set up peruser
943_3	0	a	to go step further making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support more
943_4	1	a	allow screen capture to be taken from background task or through mdm protocol
944_1	0	a	this is useful for techs using mdm systems for example if a user has an issue and calls their tech support they can request a screen capture and help them resolve
945_1	1	a	implement a free app of the week deal like apple does with ios
945_2	1	a	create a subclass of panel that allows absolutepositioning of its children yet honours the layout bounds imposed by its own parent unlike canvas which is unlimited in size and must be clipped to stop the overflow of any children
945_3	0	a	i recently bought a nokia lumia and when i tried to sync my contact with hotmail contact i receive the following error message f this contact couldnt be updated on server appreciate your idea on this
945_4	1	a	hey guyspeople love universal search in windows why dont you try to make it universal for search button on windows phone
945_5	1	a	we need override base keyboard with adding custom keys
945_6	1	a	and adding new text function add text from reading qrcode
945_7	1	a	on the keyboard near the space button add new button input from camera
945_8	0	a	if you push this button start camera app and starting search qrcode
945_9	0	a	full support for the applr earpods
945_10	0	a	it is nearly impossible to edit videos recorded by the phone on the isolated storage it shouldnt be this hard
945_11	0	a	one has to write its own libraries simply to encode and decode videos and access the frames let alone manipulate them and do something useful
945_12	0	a	even with native code support on wp it is very time consuming to port existing libraries to do this
945_13	1	a	i think it would be much easier to just provide apis for the hardware encoderdecoder to edit videos on isolated storage and with better performance
945_14	0	a	a collegue of mine with an android smartphone has just showed me on this phone an android launcher called launcher what i saw was a windows look and feel and much much more functionality than my windows nokia lumia has
946_1	0	a	and when i say much more i mean much more
946_2	0	a	summa sumarum buy launcher or give us a way to customize the user experience ourselves
946_3	0	a	some of our use cases require geofences eg
946_4	0	a	when enteringleaving a state or reaching city limits
946_5	1	a	please give support to equalizer and visualization for music
946_6	1	a	atleast provide the uri to launch native equalizer from phones setting
946_7	0	a	the css selector is ignored in the webbrowser component of windowsphone

946_11	0	a	the existing pubcenter or bing ads performance on windows phone is very poor
946_12	1	a	indie developers need a better performing advertising team and ad control
946_13	1	a	can microsoft take advertising support seriously and provide world wide ad promotion and delivery
947_1	0	a	as it is indie developers have lost confidence in microsoft efforts in pubcentrebing ads and are moving to different ad controls and investing into android and ios platforms until microsoft starts to demonstrate that it is serious about providing revenue performant adversting services
947_2	1	a	we would like a wifi csp so we can configure users wifi this is useful from an it tech user perspective
947_3	1	a	our mdm solution allows users to do this for ios and anroid would be nice if we could do it for wp too
947_4	1	a	add customized website other than youtube for media on windows phone studio app website
947_5	1	a	i have website that run media on wp without need to coversion however the only media data source available is youtube we need customization to add url of websites
947_6	0	a	so that it not ring or vibrate when you get a new message
947_7	0	a	best regards from germany
947_8	1	a	we would like to know when users remove their company app management from their devices a kind of sync ml checkout message ability to configure the company app with one click on a link like companyappuserfoopwdbarservercontosocom then user clicks on it on a mail sees a warning and accept then it automatically connects to the server the ability to install pkcs certificates add website tiles on the main menu of the phone using mdm query location using syncml commands
947_9	0	a	if you ever selected ru and ruru laguages then it causes tile localization show the enusdefault tile localization to show
947_10	0	a	when i removed the ru language code and published my new version the old version still remains with replaced and unpublished
947_11	0	a	which means the new version not fully replaced the old version
947_12	0	a	and this causes me very serious problems
948_1	0	a	some of my users will still receive the old version of my app after weeks
948_2	0	a	the store randomly gives the old or the new version of my app
948_3	0	a	sometimes the store gives the wrong wp version of my app to windows phone users
948_4	0	a	so i am very unhappy
948_5	1	a	it should be an option to remove the ru language code from my app language history
948_6	1	a	or add and implement an appreslibdllxxxxmui for the ru language culture in the documentation appreslibdllxxxxmui exist only for ruru and not for ru culture tom if you ever selected ru and ruru laguages then it causes tile localization show the enusdefault tile localization to show
948_7	0	a	my app has a wp version and a wp version xap more
948_8	0	a	ability to hide pictures from picture gallery and unhide them ie file managers without app
949_1	1	a	i think the whole system of submitting a idea is fine for a add on but the system needs a overhaul
949_2	0	a	users need to vote most votes get done
950_1	0	a	you need simple groups
952_1	0	a	regardless of votes group or technical people should check them regularly for ideas and bundle them together in a service pack
952_2	0	a	cough cough
952_3	0	a	or reply to the suggestions with reason why its not possible
952_4	0	a	the call history is missing the following menus
953_1	0	a	save number contact sms txt number rely you only have delete and block
953_2	0	a	this is highly annoying for non contact numbers
953_3	0	a	ability to lock default media hub and office hub using password
953_4	0	a	profiles like office meeting outdoors or night have proven useful and apps like situations made them automatic
954_1	0	a	sure profiles would attract many nokia users to wp products
954_2	1	a	please provide full access to the contactstore eg updating deleting etc
954_3	0	a	also if i create a contact in the contactstore then search contacts it returns the ones ive created but there is no extended properties that will enable me to know ive created it in my custom store
954_4	1	a	so please provide this extra info in the contact data returned with a search
954_5	1	a	can you please provide a report viewer control to view ssrs reports in windows phone
954_6	0	a	apps quest submission doesnt work
955_1	0	a	always says the url is invalid yet the url works
955_2	1	a	i think that would be useful if we can get the number of reviews and avarage rating by country in the dev center report
955_3	0	a	sometimes reviews can be for previous versions of the app
955_4	0	a	this can lead to some confusion about complaints in the reviews and whether they were fixed or not
957_1	0	a	many times ive read reviews for apps and decided to not get it because i was unsure whether it was listened to and fixed or not
957_2	0	a	ios has this implemented in their store and i believe it works great
957_3	0	a	if its not a legal issue i firmly believe this needs to be implemented in the windows phone store
958_1	0	a	hope you all able to update the facebook apps for window as the chat room message not able to download file attachment like words excel to maximize the utility of microsoft office usage you all should included the function of downloading file attachment to allow user like me to have wide rage of office usage
958_2	1	a	the windows phone emulator should include the ability to manage vm snapshots for windows phone images
958_3	1	a	developers should be able to create wp images that are tailored to be in a specific state and manage those image snapshots
959_1	0	a	hyperv is a powerful vm management tool and it includes the ability to create new images and manage snapshots within them allowing developers to save the current state of the vm eg to manage particular testing scenarios such as upgrading the app when a good amount of custom data is in it either for one app or multiple or to roll the state back to a prior checkpoint marked in the vm
959_2	1	a	emulator image tooling should be expanded to include the following create a new developer vm image from one of the base images delete a created developer vm image be able to addremove developer vm images from the visual studio deviceemulator list additional tooling in the emulator to allow for snapshot management of developer vm images under this suggestion the developer should be unable to manage or modify the basestandard images this suggestion is only for adding additional images

959_4	0	a	is it possible to create a traffic counter that can show how many traffic i have by wifi or by gms lte
959_5	0	a	best regards and a happy new year karsten klein
960_1	1	a	i would like to have an option for each skydrive folder to make them available offline
960_2	0	a	because not everywhere in the countryside or even in cities a good network connection is available
960_3	0	a	so those folders could be downloaded completely to the phone when a wifi is available to access them offline later
960_4	0	a	hi instead of writing elaborate syncml services i would like to do the same using push notification like what is happening in ios
960_5	0	a	we can still have dm client and the dm client can react to push messages provided the device is enrolled
960_6	0	a	push notification free options like gcm google cloud message
960_7	0	a	it is imperative for certain apps that some form of persistent background connectivity be allowed
960_8	0	a	i appreciate the need reducing wastes of battery power but if microsoft believes in putting the user in control then allow the user to enable access to persistent tcp connections on an app by app basis as windows allows
960_9	0	a	inefficient apps can then be disallowed by the user while still enabling experienced developers the flexibility to offer apps for legacy protocols that cant be converted to a push notification system among other users
960_10	1	a	the gzipstream class should be available for windows phone developers so we dont have to rely on rd party libraries to compress and decompress streams
962_1	1	a	you should put the shuffle repeat and like buttons in the popup music menu
963_1	1	a	i would like to see a single finger swipe across the entire navigation button area act as an app switch gesture
963_2	0	a	coming from webos navigation on wp feels very stilted
963_3	0	a	simply put full swipe from right to left would swap to the next app in the back stack while a full swipe from left to right would swap to the previous app in the back stack
963_4	0	a	please help
963_5	0	a	to add the possibility of managing the blacklist of phone numbers using api windows phone
964_1	0	a	wcf discovery not supported in windows phone
964_2	1	a	would be great to discover service hosts in local networks
964_3	1	a	it will be great to have an option to disable the infinite looping of pivot and panorama controls and use them in a similar way like picturearticle browsing etc
964_4	0	a	having users enroll their phone using the same mdm client no matter the vendor is a nice idea
964_5	0	a	however if an it tech is using the same mdm vendor across all platforms the enrollment experience is then totally different
964_6	0	a	we would like to make the enrollment process consistent for our users
964_7	1	a	can we have an api to enroll the device through an app or allow mdm enrollment to initiate through a browser download
965_1	0	a	the idea of background agents expiring if they have not been reinitialized in two weeks makes sense
966_1	0	a	however in some scenarios they do not make sense
966_2	0	a	we have a company hub app that is downloaded after mdm enrollment this hub app uses a background task to post back some device info and location which is not available through the mdm protocol
966_3	1	a	there is no user interaction here so we would like to be able to set the expiry to never for our background tasks in this scenario
966_4	0	a	the only workaround just now is to keep track of when tasks were set up and send the user a toast to get them to click and activate the app
966_5	0	a	the only workaround just now is to keep track of when tasks were more
966_6	0	a	after installing the gdr dev preview on my lumia there have been instances where my phone will restart after trying to open an app or save a contact
966_7	0	a	just wanted to throw that out there it has only happened three times since i updated a week or two ago
966_8	1	a	as a developer i would like to have method to defer app deactivationsuspending in order to call async methods easily
966_9	1	a	support a greater variety of microsoft media foundation apis such as the ones that allow adjustment of pitch and playback speed
966_10	0	a	advanced audio apis would allow developers to create music applications for musicians etc
966_11	0	a	the current list of support apis is rather limited
966_13	0	a	like xe from embarcadero get visual studio to create ios and android apps
966_14	1	a	lure in devs from other platforms who can also compile for wp and winrt
966_15	0	a	for each start of phone change picture by one of those selected before in the configuration
966_16	0	a	there are few websites with letter domain name and ie doesnt store cookies for this domains
967_1	0	a	when it will be fixed
967_2	0	a	in ios and andorid we have the option like allow installing appsallow camera allow screen captue etc

967_10	1	a	id suggest to include all transactions in the report
967_11	0	a	or at least distinct records different taxes sales price date time
967_12	0	a	currently an evaluation which downloads were billed at which price is not possible
967_13	0	a	i think its good that th apps can access to the list of installed apps and can decide to unistall or freeze or lock etc
967_14	0	a	bing science app will regroup all the news in the world about astronomy biology physics technology etc
967_15	0	a	the cover of the live tiles will be like a bottle of chemistry sort of
967_16	0	a	what do you think
967_17	1	a	it would be good to know not only the number of downloads but also how many are active still
967_18	0	a	if you have seen the google store they show active installations more prominently than total download count and that actually makes sense considering the amount of trash apps going around in all the phone os
967_20	0	a	we would like to create an app to monitor the time users spend in other the apps enabling enterprise customers to optimize a users day by analyzing time on applications
967_21	0	a	my original account expired and i was forced to create a new account when i decided to enroll again

969_8	0	a	it would better allow me to judge the effectiveness of my marketing
969_9	1	a	add the ability to see lyrics of music files in the music application for running music
969_11	0	a	auto rotation of keyboard not working for all apps
970_1	0	a	for example microsofts apps separately and nokia s apps separately and so on
971_1	0	a	if you have a password set on your lockscreen swipe up to show the password keyboard
971_2	0	a	then dismiss keyboard
972_1	0	a	now swipe right to log into kids corner instead of regular start
972_2	0	a	password is required even for kids corner now
972_3	0	a	this will stay until the parent types in their password
972_4	0	a	if the kid swipes right correctly at first then no issue

972_6	1	a	provide an option to keep a keepalive connection in background so that we can create im
972_7	0	a	i was surprised cause there is no resourcedictionary template in add new ite dialog
972_8	0	a	though blend has this template
972_9	0	a	isnt it better to allow developers to change their app name inside app store according to different language and culture
972_10	0	a	currently it supposes to be reading all names from some dll files in the xap bundleif you have support for different languages but it failed and the name displayed in app store can actually harm the ranking of the app
972_11	0	a	creating those dlls is a pain in the xxx

973_2	0	a	any updates on the nested virtualization
973_3	0	a	i want to run the windows phone emulator in a virtual machine but it failed
974_1	0	a	does it mean the nested virtualization is not supported yet
974_2	1	a	provide an automation toolkit to enable developers to walk through a series of steps and take screenshots at relevant points then rerun those steps in different languages to automate the process of taking screenshots in different languages for app submission
974_3	1	a	would also be helpful in its own right for general localization testing to verify that localized strings have messed up layout

978_1	0	a	not all developers care about all emulator images that are displayed in the vs list
978_2	1	a	an developer should have an option or tool to manage that list and select which ones are displayed
978_3	0	a	ideally this tool would show the developer all of the wp emulators on the machine can be scoped to only those emulators in the standard directory bonus points if able to add other directories for custom images and allow the developer to selectcheck off those emulators that she wants shown int he deviceemulator dropdown box within visual studio
978_4	0	a	particularly as the number of optional device images that developers can download and install increase this becomes a more critical need to keep the windows phone development workspace clean
978_5	0	a	related uv suggestion not all developers care about all emulator images that are displayed in the vs list
978_6	0	a	particularly as the number of optional device images that more

980_3	0	a	however as i understand it the appropriate apis to create something similar for windows pho e are inaccessible
980_4	0	a	windows phone application development should be possible with currently supported windows versions eg windows vista and not limited to only the latest windows version that has limited adoption and hardware requirements
980_5	0	a	given that the emulator is virtual anyway i am unsure why my development environment is limited in such a way
980_6	0	a	limiting the development environment to windows only limits my ability to develop for windows phone and ultimately will pull down microsoft

988_10	0	a	then here is the reason they list for failing it select yes when asked to play music observe that the games music plays simultaneously with the phones music by their own reasoning you can see that my game met the criteria by not pausing resuming or stopping the music
988_11	0	a	this tester changed the criteria
988_12	0	a	whats worse is that his boss eric dunaway agreed with the tester in his misreading of the criteria
989_1	0	a	then here is the reason they list for failing it select yes when asked to play music observe that more

995_17	0	a	now that native development is an option its very frustrating that one cant debug the native code thats being executed on the device without a real device
995_18	0	a	back in the windows mobilece days microsoft had a device emulator that would faithfully emulate an arm cpu and would execute exactly that same code that eventually went to the device
995_19	0	a	this capability was essential for certain lowlevel tasks like native crash investigation debugging stack clobbering scenarios deep optimization with inline assembly examplefor neon and such
996_1	0	a	now that capability is lost
996_2	1	a	please bring it back
997_1	1	a	give some api to find out these thingandroid and iphone provide apis to find out these thingand dont give accuses because of security reasonsandroid and iphone is also secureso work on it and provide some api because in mobile technology it is very difficult to create application without this

998_3	0	a	why not supporting dominated windows
998_4	1	a	please provide access for fm radio apis in wp and also the ability to change the audio route as currently the built in fm radio is capable of
998_5	0	a	i currently i use a wp class library to access the fm apis but these does not provide the means of changing the audio route
999_1	0	a	the ability to change to audio route for the medialibrary would also be great
999_2	0	a	the build in music video apps fm radio switch to speakerphone is very nice but when going back and playing music from the media library it switch to the headphones that had to be plugged in to enable the fm radio
1000_1	0	a	that is very inconvenient so it would be great if the audio route is always in sync between the fm radio and media library
1000_2	0	a	the build in music video apps fm radio switch to speakerphone is very nice but when going back and playing music from the media library it switch to the headphones that had more

1002_2	0	a	i need this to give the user a signal he shouldcan react on
1002_3	1	a	just like the user can select apps that are allowed to run in the background it would be great if they could select apps that are allowed to change phone settings
1002_4	1	a	for example i would love it if my gps app could turn location on when the app starts and turn it back off when the app exits
1003_1	0	a	when entering a payment method theres no option to delete an existing payment method before entering a new one
1003_2	0	a	this is a problem when credit cards constantly fail authorization

1006_2	0	a	i could only control the device with a keyboard plugged in to the usb port
1006_3	0	a	i tried everything then used system restore to restore to the previous restore point that got me back up and running

1007_2	0	a	im developing more than applications however has encountered an obstacle
1008_1	0	a	i can not develop because i can not transfer more than three applications for apphub
1008_2	0	a	how can i remove this limit so i could develop end applications
1008_3	0	a	because we cannot pay for an expensive azure cloud service everytime we need to connect to a database
1008_4	1	a	please implement file upload api for internet explorer so we can upload pdfs docs from office hub images and videos
1008_5	0	a	currently uc browser allows us to upload pictures only and so does number of messaging apps
1008_6	0	a	but none of them let us upload anything from office hub
1008_7	0	a	however internet explorer doesnt let us upload anything
1008_8	0	a	please see this

1008_11	0	a	it took days i forgot my password now i have to reset the whole phone just for it
1008_12	0	a	so if i can lock my phone through windowsphonecom why cant i unlock it the same way when i forget my password
1009_1	1	a	allow the phone to be used as a mini presentation device
1010_1	0	a	this can allow the phone to be used as a secondary display or project the screen contents on for example pushtv devices or widi receivers

1010_8	0	a	ive asked the support they said me that i have to create another subscription with another live account and after it ask them to migrate apps and related data
1010_9	0	a	but he also said that not all of the data would be possible to transfer like reporting
1010_10	0	a	well the big deal for me is that i wont to create another account
1010_11	0	a	its not healthy to keep several accounts that means nothing specially ones that you just had to create because some service does not allow things like a single renew
1010_12	0	a	after all it is so easier to just allow to renew than you ms having to work for transfering data from one account to another
1011_1	0	a	im delaying the registration and app creation untill it is possible
1012_1	0	a	i hope it will be

1022_3	0	a	thank you for reaching out to microsoft windows phone developer support
1023_1	0	a	i see that you are currently developing within one region and now want to develop within turkey
1024_1	0	a	turkey being one of the newest opened locations
1024_2	0	a	while we understand your current situation we cannot change your region once selected
1025_1	0	a	since changing is not an option you will need to create a new account within the turkey region
1025_2	0	a	what we can offer you is the attempt to transfer your apps to the new account
1025_3	0	a	please note not all requests can be completed
1025_4	0	a	but we can certainly attempt this for you
1025_5	0	a	since you have mentioned that you are a student account this might require you to create to simultaneous accounts
1025_6	0	a	each account must be active
1026_1	0	a	if this is something that you would like to look into please contact dreamspark as well
1026_2	0	a	note that if you have a store account the apps from that side will not transfer
1026_3	0	a	currently the option to do so is not present

1030_1	0	a	we need to share all our data from our mobile phone or sd card so we need a file manager on wp
1030_2	0	a	i want to share my music with my friends with whatsapp or any other app
1030_3	1	a	it would be great if as we have the apps menu to the right of home we have another menu to the left with notifications and shortcuts or simply the possibility of turn onoff wifi and other things like the bright the sound etc
1031_1	0	a	textboxes in windows phone builtin apps for instance in the message hub allow the user to scroll just by swiping the finger on it
1032_1	0	a	the silverlight textbox doesnt support this kind of scrolling and forces the user to long tap on it until the caret appears then move his finger to the sides of the textbox
1032_2	0	a	its imprecise and frustrating and confuses the user as hes not used to this behavior in system apps
1032_3	0	a	providing the same scrolling in the silverlightwinrt textbox would definitely improve the user experience
1032_4	0	a	in my application that plays mps over the internet often when i start a track it stops playing after some time for a second or so and then continues normally
1032_5	0	a	if i download that track and play it in standard player there is no such a glitch
1032_6	0	a	this started happening on my lumia and phones after gdr update
1032_7	1	a	you should be able to select from a dropdown menu or text box how much memory is required for your app to run or select what devices to test for
1032_8	0	a	my apps keep getting rejected because they are being tested on devices that they were not designed for
1032_9	0	a	other dev sites let you select these options during the submission process
1032_10	1	a	develop application to lock perticuler apps like msg email any apps
1032_11	0	a	there is apps in android phone that is appslock same apps should be in windows phone
1032_12	0	a	currently when using writeablebitmap or decoding image data you have to do that on the ui thread
1032_13	0	a	this is very problematic since if you need to do any heavy image processing youre slowing the ui and negatively affecting the user experience
1032_14	1	a	it would be great if there were specific classes that could be instantiated on nonui threads and then loaded by uithread image objects
1032_15	1	a	extend pushnotificationbackground task apis to allow storage of incoming push notification messages repeating of a notification as frequently as every minutes repeating the notification indefinitely until cleared by user ability to specify sounds and volume
1033_1	0	a	basically i have been attempting to write a pager style alerting application to notifying me of critical it issues and the need it to be able to wake me
1033_2	0	a	the currently limitations of apis prevent this type of app
1033_3	1	a	bring back local in bing search
1034_1	0	a	it is now inefficient chore to find local addresses
1034_2	1	a	bring back ability to copypaste addresses from bing search so people can text each other addresses to meet up at
1035_2	1	a	add the ability to connect to windowssharesamba servers
1035_3	1	a	please add sap sim access protocol bluetooth protocol
1036_1	0	a	this is required for many built in car hand frees
1037_1	0	a	sap is superior to only hf as it enables eg
1038_1	0	a	my slk to access the sim and turn the phone to stand by and use the cars transmitter giving far better reception while saving the mobiles battery
1038_2	1	a	hey please give some file manager appsmx playerswype keyboard
1038_3	0	a	a panorama template based app will attract more to youtube than static

1040_1	1	a	please unify the windows phone blue and windows development compleatly
1040_2	0	a	it is good that you started this unification with the common core
1040_3	0	a	but it should be common on all sense not just on general things but also on ui xaml code
1041_1	0	a	there are a lot of patterns out there and it is not too hard to think yourself a goodnew design pattern which unify the ui development for example
1043_1	0	a	it is ok that some things will be awailable on windows devices which are not available on windows phone and vice versa
3	1	a	please support multisegment path for this method or at least return a message giving more details
19	1	a	change bit in zip files to better comply with iso and normative appnotes from pkware in order to interoperate with other unzip software
25	1	a	your app must not contain or display content that a reasonable person would consider pornographic or sexually explicit
26	1	a	pornographic and sexually explicit needs to be well defined
30	1	a	furthermore age ratings in dev center dashboard can be set per app according to the content in the app
31	1	a	if the app fills out this information there it should not be taken down unless it has pornographic or sexually explicit material which is not well defined in store policies
41	1	a	would it be too much to ask for an api that wraps whatever mechanism is required to accomplish this
64	1	a	a container for starting applications inside it on windows iot core instead of fullscreen
67	1	a	providing separate x and y factors would enable it to be used on objects without fixed aspect ratios
71	1	a	with separate x and y scale measurements both objects could be resized via pinchstretch
75	1	a	you can use wireshark to inspect packets and see that queries having a class of any will be answered by a dnssd registration from bonjour but will not be answered by the above dnssd registration
78	1	a	create an api that takes as an argument a command as a string
79	1	a	and using that string the api may activate the command like cortana does when you say hey cortana my command but without voice interaction
96	1	a	it would be a huge advantage to support this attribute also on the appobject in the appxamlfile and to make this the ultimate root
98	1	a	allow license assignment for an application to be tied to azure ad group similar to how licenses in office can be managed
102	1	a	i want to create windows service which runs in background and checks if any barcode is scanned whenever a barcode is scanned i want the windows service to handle it and write the input to the text file
109	1	a	please make the fluent design toolkits available for affinity designer
111	1	a	would be great if setter had delay property to only execute it after a certain amount of time
112	1	a	it would be great to be able to get the current appointment and the next appointment a user has
115	1	a	add stopwatch controller
116	1	a	i want to add clock controller visually to show time
118	1	a	add printercontroller that was in wpf and winforms
120	1	a	is there anyway you could make windbg preview available for offline downloading
135	1	a	i would like to add bixby to this list
152	1	a	why dont build a phone powered by android but running customized by microsoft itself
154	1	a	also if cortana can readreply messages from the phone why not link that api or process not sure if those are the words needed for my idea to the messaging app that comes builtin on w
158	1	a	and also it will be great the microsoft expands it services internationally like for example cortana which it barely works in regions outside the us
160	1	a	i hope that microsoft pay attention to this and do something because i would like to see them making its way in the mobile department
161	1	a	pd all microsoft apps should be native on the phone and you should also build up a mobile text messaging app that sync with the messaging app on windows
173	1	a	could you please increase the maximum size or better remove it at all
186	1	a	because of this i would like the functionality to only execute the selecteditem code when a row is doubletapped
188	1	a	my proposed solution is to add a rowdoubletapped event directly to the uwp datagrid class itself
205	1	a	i would like to add a animatedheaderedtextbox control to the toolkit
216	1	a	get back the offiline symbols download
261	1	a	would it be possible to enhance the loading control to disable navigation when it is running
265	1	a	most of the screen a wide so why not a horizontal layout for colorpicker
302	1	a	as a developer i want to see the screenshots and logs my customers are sending to me via the feedback hub
311	1	a	upon a person next logging into the device it would be nice to be able to have the app restart automatically too
313	1	a	id like to see a way for any uwp app to optin to being automatically restarted when the user logs in after a shutdown caused by an automatic reboot
314	1	a	having the app receive activation parameters that indicate the cause of the restart would be great for this too
315	1	a	it would allow the appdeveloper to track why the app was restarted but more importantly it would allow for the app to provide a better experience that allows the user to continue where they last left offwith the app running and at a specific position in the app
339	1	a	nav view should be made a full proof solution for developers
340	1	a	nav view should be more integrated to the application so that the app is consistent
365	1	a	this info should be mandatory imho
370	1	a	it would be great if i could have two webview each having a different user profile
372	1	a	a command like mssettingsutilities would be very useful
381	1	a	for example an isselected property could be added to a treeviewnode or a function like selectnodetreeviewnode to the treeview
384	1	a	so ever event handler must be like one touch behaver of user
386	1	a	i think microsoft should add a new property to fonticon that combines fontfamily and glyph into a single uri property call it glyphuri
391	1	a	further i think nuget should maintain a set of tags on all their properties one of these tags should be fonticons so that when you click download new font its going to search nuget for this fonticon tag and list the packages for fonts from most popular to least popular
392	1	a	also i think nugut should maintain user comments for each packageand a star ratingso that people can get an idea if the package is any good without installing
400	1	a	could you add the link for the feedback hub to the stores app review form
401	1	a	i believe that the app review and report for developers should be divided
405	1	a	is it possible to add the note to the review form as following
418	1	a	we need to open the window as maximized
420	1	a	please provide a way to configure the size of the window in the launchuriforresultsasync method
436	1	a	take sample from here
444	1	a	run application and set breakpoint readasync method after line
488	1	a	if you are also using pinvokekerneldll please install the nugetpackage directly to the uwpproject automatic references added by other nugetpackages like pclcrypto add an older version verify the version of pinvokekerneldll in your binxdebug build output folder it should be at least
497	1	a	microsoft should give us the possibility to download created app packages for failed certification processes for further debugging
509	1	a	suggestion for pathicon datauri property for loading pathicon from a svg file instead of specifying messy vector strings nobody really wanted to put this stuff f m l in their xaml
512	1	a	another possibility is to allow datauri to point to a text file holding this type of stuff f m l
515	1	a	would be nice if you could drag your file from the project tree over to a xaml property requiring an msappx path and it would expand to an msappx path instead of a fullpath to the file on your filesystem
520	1	a	this would be well placed in the task manager performance tab a dedicated usage graph could be displayed for ml activity
524	1	a	would be nice if you could set the height of a textbox using number of lines
533	1	a	and it can be made backwards compatible with height property in pixels
537	1	a	also heightlines should automatically set acceptsreturn property to true to make it super easy to create a multiline textbox in xaml
538	1	a	i also think theres something a little bit weirld about the textbox control if you specify lines height it should say lines in height and not expand box it should just beep when you get to the end of the lines of course it would be line if they built the scrollbars into the control then it would auotmatically scroll when exceeding the lines but ill leave that for another complaint after they add a lineheight property to make it work the way people want it to work
546	1	a	the reason why its a good idea to add a heightline property is that it allows everything to be done in xaml setup the fontsize fontfamily and the pixels size automatically to expand to match exactly lines
563	1	a	from now onward please add sync methods first and optionally add supplementary async method for long operations
567	1	a	they are a welcome addition to the api but they should not be the only way to obtain data
588	1	a	it would be good to have an option in xbox device portal so that we can see the javascript console logs like network logs in http monitor tab
589	1	a	also it would be great if there is an option to inspect and debug
594	1	a	for example i can add some text or anything i please on the side instating how far is this point to the current gps location
596	1	a	in webview we can do panning by moving with fingers and zooming by pinching smooth and fluid
605	1	a	i think we should take it one step further and make notepad opensource like powershell so the opensource community can continue to add features to notepad to become the goto text editor for performing quick edits of programming
606	1	a	it would be useful for notepad to update from being a win app to a uwp one
607	1	a	in keeping with current ms strategy of bringing crossplatform apps to the windows store making notepad one of these would be extremely helpful
614	1	a	it would be convenient to have a selectedbackground property for calendarview
647	1	a	please check these links where users discussed similar issue
653	1	a	inputpane should not be opened and closed again and again for each input element
654	1	a	there should be option of preventing auto hiding when getting focus through tab button of inputpane just like preventkeyboarddisplayonprogrammaticfocus which is also not working in uwp target version
657	1	a	enable d application developers to easily use d volumetric content in xamlcomposition by configuring spatial scenes and manipulating transforms and skeletal animations
658	1	a	add a panel that allows to create a design with constraints and support in blend
664	1	a	i would like the ability to filter the call stack when trying to trace a function call
667	1	a	essentially make it as searchable as the solution explorer with the ability to add some exclusion rules
691	1	a	bring webview with edge to wpf and winforms applications
698	1	a	and now that i am in my s iam still playing and building but my mother and her friends cant keep up with windows they are having a hard time finding there way around windows please give them back the old windows that they can navigate
701	1	a	now that windows has lte support rcs messaging api should be introduced so we can take advantage of this messaging protocol in our uwp apps
707	1	a	attach devices to another and ensure it full loading
709	1	a	hot unplug and wait about s
724	1	a	now my idea all controls could have a default property for localization
726	1	a	an attribute could be used to identify the default localization property for a xaml control
729	1	a	it might be placed in a menuflyout in a button in a appbarbutton
737	1	a	maybe at least if using the simplified folddown mode panning other file formats could be supported
738	1	a	in webb for hololens running apps section should have a column that tell the user account under which a appprocess is running
744	1	a	i would like to ask microsoft developers to fix this issue and provide couple extra degrees of freedom going through the rdc
755	1	a	i think we can support this by adding a simple constructor that takes in the same parameters as initialize
772	1	a	add loginhint as optional param to loginasync and plumb through getusertokenvasync
783	1	a	so it would be great to have access to this values to stay on track with actual developments from other vendors
785	1	a	introduce functionality so that mac address can be obtained programmatically
789	1	a	another possiblity is to add an attribute to button called
800	1	a	if custom tiles are being displayed get the watermarks associated with them
801	1	a	since we are passing a string via the xbind attribute to some ui controls it would be nice if we could make the binding to a readonlyspant so we avoid allocations
803	1	a	you could rename the windows mobile to windows watch and you could stop making the lumia mobile phones but you could start making lumia smartwatch with windows watch
805	1	a	it needs to work as good as the one available in winmmdll
810	1	a	please add a semiautomated test queue mode to driver verifier where you can select a group of drivers and then have driver verifier test them one at a time moving down the queue one position with each reset or reboot
813	1	a	an automated test queue would be wonderful in a situation like this
818	1	a	please look into how musicians and developers use midi and what we would like to be able to do with devices like the surface and prioritize giving us the ability to innovate here
822	1	a	the swipecontrol control should support mouse input as well as touch input
828	1	a	i personally would like to be able to have a similar arrangement in my own apps but currently am unable to do so
840	1	a	resize the windows explorer window to something like px to px
844	1	a	to fix it just resize the window to a bigger proportion of the screen when is not fullscreen and then maximize it again
855	1	a	add an option to let user do so
856	1	a	it might make sense to have that option in task manager since it is the tool to control startup tasks in windows
857	1	a	adding an image editor to captureelement control with these options ability to save captured image as predefined image types jpg pngetc
867	1	a	how about an option to automatically delete the automatic checkpoint when the machine starts
871	1	a	add store uri schema like mswindowsstoreassocappextq to search app extensions
873	1	a	it would be useful if this feature can be supported in windows
877	1	a	i want the screen setting to be an option where i can set my preferance as a default
882	1	a	itd be great if we could chain functions together in xbind to create more complex expressions
884	1	a	rather than writing a specific function for this purpose itd be nice if it could be composed of individual pieces that can be combined in many more ways
895	1	a	it would be good if we could submit utility tools to the store as there is no way to perform these tasks without admin
896	1	a	maybe warn the user when downloading the app or more stringent verification process for these apps but dont block them completely as youre hurting both devs and users
898	1	a	with the publisher in the manifest locked to the developer name as well this should be implemented to make uwp apps much easier to distribute outside of the store
900	1	a	please improve the app submission process for internalbeta testing
907	1	a	provide a lock to the tiles so that the tiles wont get collapsed accidentally
908	1	a	button to right click and left click in the touchpad of continuum control display in mobile will be very helpful
909	1	a	i have more than apps in the store and would like to see all downloads of these apps as a number
929	1	a	but i hope my suggestion will be passed to where it can be the most helpful
932	1	a	the first feature i wanted to suggest is that i believe cortana is lacking certain capabilities on apple ios specifically the ability for cortana to send emails from the cortana app directly by outlook for iphone
933	1	a	similar to how cortana handles text messages it would be nice if cortana could draft an email onto outlook for the iphone
934	1	a	the second insight i would like to provide for feedback is on the cortanas speech recognition on apple ios and android and user input
939	1	a	however i would still appreciate being able to see a text message notification i have received on my iphone from cortana
956	1	a	vr is not just wanted for gaming but for business apps too
979	1	a	suggestion if the returned storagefile class could not provide the actual entry of the choices selected by the user maybe the filesavepicker could do it with a readonly property or method after the user confirmed the file
988	1	a	m could try again to develop great software again as many years before which your customers want to install themselves because its just fun to work with and it brings great benefits to users
991	1	a	the could start with small things like this feedback form which is annoying too
1002	1	a	trysetwallpaperimageasync only supports a primary display rather than allowing the wallpaper to be set for any attached displays
1004	1	a	add a switch statement for xaml which allows app developers to modify parts of a layout based on a value
1010	1	a	i would like to add the functionality myself or contribut if somebody could help me
1015	1	a	i think ms needs to provide more support for schools thinking about cloudbook using windows s
1017	1	a	id like a user voice where we can request certain software be added to the windows store
1018	1	a	id like students to be able to install scratch and sketchup for example
1022	1	a	but it would be good for ms to approach in reverse based on school feedback
1036	1	a	update apps same time as ios and android updates theirs
1038	1	a	include gestures that could allow users minimize apps for example with three fingers
1064	1	a	please set some heat sensing app by default in your windows before it is too late
1066	1	a	set a multi alarm software so that it can cope coming world situations
1068	1	a	let us make a different type of os which can understand and not only communicates with the user
1088	1	a	it would be extremely helpful if we could create a custom dictionaryword listconstraint as we can already with speech recognition as it was possible in the old microsoftink api
1107	1	a	please add windows update to default rules
1120	1	a	please unhamstring windows and support process isolation for containers
1131	1	a	please allow that api in in background
1132	1	a	microsoft should reenable the windows bridge for android
1135	1	a	get public tweets without users authentication
1137	1	a	take any xaml page add a button to it and bind it to any normal as in not a command on the view model
1138	1	a	compile the app and the xaml compiler throws the exception
1152	1	a	with proper hooks many different scenario variations could be achieved
1154	1	a	lets say there is a app which display news stories
1165	1	a	in my opinion developers should not have to do this to prevent multiple unintended events from a control
1166	1	a	we need a fix to ensure that the contol stops forwarding click events after it has been clicked multiple times without manually adding code to each and every async handler
1178	1	a	closing the streamsocket by disposingdeleting it should stop all the pending asynchronous operations reads or writes
1181	1	a	it would be nice it there was an api discovery endpoint
1183	1	a	adding visibility property on expander and making the header invisible will make the panel looks like it is sliding into the view
1189	1	a	allowing uwp access packaged com will eliminate this overhead allow simpler architecture and allow reuse much more traditional win apps
1193	1	a	hi you really need to fix the xbox app store
1203	1	a	at the very least publishing on xbox should be an opt in function when publishing not an opt out one
1211	1	a	it would be nice if you also ported the ads into uwp apis so that they can be used with desktop bridge apps
1216	1	a	please add wmi support on uwp
1225	1	a	these apis ought to be allowed for any uwp application but are most useful when working with runtime code generation
1237	1	a	id like to see an api to create virtual midi ports built into windows
1238	1	a	the surface touch screen has tons of possibilities as a midi controller but this currently requires installing a rd party driver which is not a great end user experience
1239	1	a	built in rtpmidi would be nice too but at least this would be achievable without a kernel mode driver if we had virtual midi ports
1254	1	a	allow uwp applications to tick a box in the appxmanifest declaring it as a fulltrust desktop application
1255	1	a	prevent fulltrust apps from targeting phone and xbox if you have to
1260	1	a	if its an issue virtualize the registry as with the desktop bridge
1262	1	a	look the concept of uwp apps can run on your phone rip and your xbox while admirable isnt practical for most applications
1268	1	a	show a notice to users upon install more
1271	1	a	it would be nice to have an attached property for scrollviewer to set middle click scrolling
1289	1	a	code would be useful in adapting to bluetooth applications
1299	1	a	check the create date on the file
1303	1	a	wait one minute so the clock shows a new minute and the run the code again
1309	1	a	if you go into the explorer and delete the file and create it in explorer with the same name the create date is correct
1323	1	a	following the comments on the blog post for afunix it would be nice to see sockseqpacket andor sockdgram support
1333	1	a	i would like to vote to have this feature be configurable in settings allowing users to disable this feature
1340	1	a	please add support for cryptuiwiz api to handle timestampreply
1346	1	a	cant the reason of revocation of extended execution be a little more specific than systempolicy applicationclosing applicationsuspended
1349	1	a	in uwp project follow xaml code make a win exception when minimum target is build
1359	1	a	allow copypaste in settings pages for path instructions and especially in failureerror outcomes for self repair fix researchlookups
1367	1	a	it is possible to disable suggestions in the settings but i guess apps should be able to disable this themselves
1379	1	a	will be possible to share the roadmap on the lcow improvment
1385	1	a	grouping another optional feature to enable grouping on basis of a string property of the items
1396	1	a	search bar a top search bar attached to the control which can be enableddisabled with a boolean property
1404	1	a	one of the problems in here is unity code which is mostly made to be singleinstance but it would be great to have support to launch multiple instances of the same app
1417	1	a	id like to add itemclick event to the carousel control to be able to use it as item listing control with the ability to click on items like in the gridview and listview
1423	1	a	so please remove this restriction
1425	1	a	if this is a privacy constraint then please consider to add a capability that can be declared in the app manifest
1426	1	a	based on this it also could notify the user at first appstart like it is done with the camera access
1436	1	a	markdowntextclock should provide linkcommand alongside linkclicked event
1438	1	a	it would be good if textboxregex will be automatically delete letters at input like the textboxmask
1439	1	a	maybe a new validationmode type would make sense here
1440	1	a	can you add the d viewer object that is used by paint d and mixed reality viewer
1441	1	a	include the mouse and keyboard support
1442	1	a	make it available for net wpf also and via nuget
1448	1	a	please add an overload to create a mediastreamsample from a dd surface
1451	1	a	but it would be even better if we could configure the compiler somehow through a special screen in the properties or through an optional configuration file
1452	1	a	in such a configuration we could enter for example default binding modes for specific dependency properties like for example twoway for textboxtextproperty
1461	1	a	get rid of the emailmessagebody character limit
1462	1	a	if you have such limits publish them in the api docs
1472	1	a	the aforementioned forum post suggests using a remote api as a work around
1475	1	a	please give developers the option to not participate in the upcoming sets feature
1481	1	a	recommendation contentdialog should do the locking so that the user does not have to
1489	1	a	to have a dialog that can be used at any time and that always shows centered on the main window of the app you must have two copies of the dialog one embedded in xaml and shown using inplace but only if it is loaded and the other not embedded in xaml and shown using popup
1491	1	a	recommendation add a parameter to showasync that positions the dialog relative to the main window of the app centered left right bottom
1495	1	a	since only one contentdialog can be shown at a time a lock is needed such as semaphoreslim or a sequential queue of taskcompletionsource
1503	1	a	but it would be nice to choose what elements get discarded first in case theres isnt enough space on the tile
1509	1	a	when declaring a custom template for contentdialog the template root must contain a border with xnamecontainer otherwise the showasync method will throw a systemaccessviolationexception
1517	1	a	so i propose a download archive for windows insider preview sdks where we can download earlier versions of the preview sdks
1522	1	a	the expected behaviour is that when you click on the primary or secondary button in a contentdialog then focus should be switched to the button concerned otherwise xbind bindings wont update
1529	1	a	please make registration posible for moldova
1542	1	a	please extend keyframeanimationsscalarkeyframeanimations to makte them pausable and resumable
1548	1	a	in mediacomposition add transitions between two clips on timeline eg
1551	1	a	i think its good if rotatortile has an indicator which shows what index is selected or maybe another control that can be attached to rotatortile
1558	1	a	the panorama mode is beautiful and if only we could have a button to call the api from inside our apps it would be great
1575	1	a	thats why i am suggesting a specialized textbox for numbers
1580	1	a	allow entering negative values
1582	1	a	allow entering decimal values
1584	1	a	format the text with a specific number of decimal place ie
1596	1	a	im suggesting a textbox with the following feature
1622	1	a	it should return dom element and coordinates and in case of image also the raw bytes
1624	1	a	at least receiving scriptnotify events should be possible on http and without adding applicationcontenturirules in manifest so that we could atleast have a way to do it on our own
1629	1	a	switch the default to lf style line endings in the whole operating system
1685	1	a	there are situations where you might want to interrupt navigating away from a page when using navigationview
1693	1	a	please provide this same information on the usage page
1703	1	a	it would be nice to be able to specify an itemssource and automatically populate it with mvvm
1801	1	a	in short we need a uwp alternative to showcaseview
1808	1	a	there should be a machine learning sdk smilar to apple coreml
1809	1	a	uwp should include a augmented reality sdk simlar to apple arkit and google ar dev kit
1811	1	a	could you add this to the list of uwp apis supported in desktop bridge
1812	1	a	i really need to be able to programmatically restart my app
1819	1	a	please fix it to support hiding pivotitems correctly especially during data binding when you cant simply addremove it from the items collection
1860	1	a	please make esent jet blue technology open source and available on net core and xamarin for operating systems other than windows
1865	1	a	new control to add multiples tags with close button and auto suggestion functionality
1870	1	a	please add allaccountsreadwrite to userdataaccountstoreaccesstype in order to allow to creates calendars on remote calendar providers
1873	1	a	provide funtionality similar to currentappsimulator class found in windowsapplicationmodelstore namespace
1876	1	a	another solution could be simply extend office store in order to publish vsto addin
1886	1	a	please add reveal effect on each item on the listview in the hamburger menu control as per creators fall update
1887	1	a	the possibility to make optional packages plugins with code for inprocess with c andor vbnet instead of c
1889	1	a	when i make store listings for several languages i would like to be able to just right click on a listing then copy it and edit not be troubled with details on cvs and excell
1890	1	a	also would like to see when exactly a listing was updated
1898	1	a	please add to uwp ble api methods to interrogate ble stack connection settings
1900	1	a	you may wish to consider my flippdfviewercontrol for inclusion in the toolkit
1907	1	a	it would be good to see support for setting a gridview inside a listview which has the ability to add columns
1939	1	a	so your are not able to suggest a folder or file to the user by a pathstring
1946	1	a	what would be helpful is to have a service in the toolkit to get an azure ad token
1958	1	a	having access to the visibility of the system back button is good but there are some scenarios where i think it would make sense to have a disabled state for this button which could be toggled by devs in certain scenarios
1963	1	a	it would be nice to have a way to automate updateupgrade bash ubuntu on windows that does not require to start bash
1965	1	a	you should update all the constants for the paper sizes for example constant for cr or business card and pos receipt paper wasnt stated but you wrote other sizes are being reserved
1968	1	a	please allow generic classes to be base classes of xaml pagescontrols
1985	1	a	obviously i would expect in point that neighboring files should still be available but maybe slightly slower
1996	1	a	allow winappdriver to switch context from native to webview
2002	1	a	imagine writing text directly into the textbox or richeditbox canvas without the inkkeyboardoverlay
2007	1	a	by the way speech recognition should be handled the same way
2008	1	a	so come on all the apis are already there give windows ink a boost
2010	1	a	would be a lot more intuitive useful and less distractive then the current overlay
2026	1	a	please make sure the pinvoke either points to a windows api allowed in uwp applications or a native dll that is part of the package
2040	1	a	if for some reason your pinvoke does not satisfy those requirements please use dllimportexactspellingtrue to indicate that you understand the implications more
2041	1	a	move from onedrive sdk to microsoft graph
2042	1	a	add msal support for v auth model
2045	1	a	could this not also be provided in the uwp toolkit for inclusion in uwp apps
2046	1	a	add a custom calendarview control with more personalization options than the one included in the sdk
2056	1	a	individual calendarmonthview control so that if you want to display standalone months you can maybe you display a grid of months etc
2103	1	a	i think in first case must be fired buttonpressed event too like it happens on phone call
2105	1	a	it would be very useful to be able to immediately release the memory held by a uwp bitmapimage which can be significant for large images
2112	1	a	please make it possible to locate at the other three corners
2113	1	a	we need backward compatibility for xaml just like android for example we can just use navigationview without any conditional check at all
2115	1	a	please add support for composition visual to handle pointer interactions
2120	1	a	it would be nice to have a uwpor xamarin community tutorial where devs can contribute to the tutorial and make it up to date
2123	1	a	create a cordova plugin to enable ios and android hybrid apps to use project rome features
2137	1	a	i would really like to switch to uwp for development however i am not able to elevate users to install a uwp app that win apps wouldnt have any problem just downloading from a network drive
2176	1	a	and also in full screen i would expect transport controls to ignore safe area
2183	1	a	could microsoft not add a padding reflecting the core window bounds to the fullscreen window only instead of manipulating a grid by name
2196	1	a	i want the transport controls semitransparent area more
2208	1	a	add tumblr service too
2210	1	a	we could also be able to start tracking packages directly too
2212	1	a	consider a full screen application where youd like to temporarily control that brightness
2218	1	a	please extend the api to run on desktop and mobile devices not in embedded mode
2250	1	a	it would be better if it was as fast as the webclient class used in a desktop application
2260	1	a	both problems could be solved by adding groupstyleitemtemplate
2262	1	a	and virtualization could be optimized as well by using container cache per group
2266	1	a	imagine a image viewer where you have one group folders and one group images
2267	1	a	folders must of course use a very different item template than images
2273	1	a	i want to see a better windows store first where my apps can be found
2279	1	a	please give the highest priority to improve app discoverability in windows store
2280	1	a	apps must be found by keywords
2291	1	a	it would make sense that the app be published to the private store and users who have not been allocated a license should have the ability to request a license rather than just getting an error message
2318	1	a	for events the target method must not be overloaded
2323	1	a	add a control that reminds users to rate your uwp app after a certain amount of time or app launches
2336	1	a	depth tests are needed for fast skipping occluded pixels and depth reads in the shader are needed for calculating particle opacity to make them soft
2348	1	a	set depth writes enabled or disabled set other state changes make the draw call
2352	1	a	in my opinion the dddsvreadonlydepth is really useless and should be removed any state validation for reading and writing to the depth texture should just check for dddepthstencildescdepthwritemask in each draw call
2353	1	a	however to dont sacrifice performance those validation checks should be performed only in debug mode ddsetexceptionmodeddraiseflagdriverinternalerror and in that case the draw call should still be allowed but it only should issue a debug warning writing to depth and reading from it in the shader may produce undefined results
2355	1	a	you should trust the application to let it manage the correct state changes on its own without introducing artificial limitations and sacrificing performance
2360	1	a	this would result in smaller memory usage faster performance smaller cpu overhead power usage longer battery life
2364	1	a	you will dont have to do these checks if this artificial requirement is removed from dx api
2374	1	a	add ability to conditionally trigger a keyframe animation from an expression animation in order to support more complex animation scenarios
2386	1	a	camon we need a service status page with we have issue were working on
2397	1	a	we already have the pulltorefreshlistview in the toolkit so we can also integrate this functionality into the control and change the name to something more suitable like listviewex and have both of the functionality in a single control
2407	1	a	please make the control usable in an app
2416	1	a	make a menu with information about the files being locked by an application
2418	1	a	it would save a tons of space to only have one small svg for a simple icon rather than a dozen large png files
2422	1	a	add eyedropper ability to pick color outside of the uwp app
2424	1	a	there should be a form developers can fill out to request expedited review
2444	1	a	it would be useful if this limitation were removed allowing physical web support to be developed using windows alone without requiring additional hardware resources to publish beacons
2462	1	a	can we please improve the situation by adding missing api
2467	1	a	for my work app we wanted the app to launch maximised
2468	1	a	the closet option is to launch it fullscreen but that obscures the task bar
2498	1	a	allow app to launch uri with http schema in default video or audio player not only store player win apps support will be great
2509	1	a	what would be really helpful is to provide an event maybe something like directmanipulationcompleting that would fire as soon as the pointer is released eg
2525	1	a	allow to register background tasks to be registered when die app is first installed from store or sideloaded without having the need to start the app first
2527	1	a	we need something like an installationtask
2528	1	a	allow their to be faster response times for contacting app store after submitting feedback link found at the bottom of the certification report after having your app rejected
2536	1	a	in japanese input the font style should be applied to the left character
2552	1	a	itd be great if the slider control could have a tickoffset property to make the tick marks not start at the leftmost edge of the control
2556	1	a	it would be nice to be able to easily create rounded or circular buttons in uwp without creating custom control template
2579	1	a	allow us to withdrawal the money because we dont know when we can reach the threshold usd
2583	1	a	this can be really helpful if you want to easily create a multilingual cortana experience if you use resw
2592	1	a	so we hope that uwp image control and imagesource can support more and more pixelformat like as wpf net framework
2599	1	a	example page app should be configured to use dark theme
2602	1	a	to recreate paste the below xaml into a blank page and run be sure the app is configured to use dark theme
2612	1	a	accessing this information through an api would be useful for creating automated kpi reports
2617	1	a	as a windows developer i would like the site to be improved to give a reasonable performance
2636	1	a	create new user control with ability to selecte date and time something similar to in wpftoolkit
2637	1	a	please add headeredcontentcontrol to the community toolkit
2640	1	a	would like to see the possibility to add a search bar to the master details view that filters results in the master pane
2652	1	a	downloadgetpercentage to get the download compleated percentage so that it can be used for creating progessbar
2656	1	a	should support background download
2658	1	a	allow the webview to display uri from the applications local folder
2704	1	a	raise single events but its bad for performance
2710	1	a	raise reset event
2717	1	a	enewitems but simple pick the first one
2731	1	a	so please allow uwp apps without net native
2733	1	a	i wish the interstitialad will have builtin animation at least a fadein effect when it shows
2740	1	a	a better option would be to add a new role option for the accounts to indicate which accounts can raise support issues
2744	1	a	it just needs the context command that returns the current context name which could be hardcoded as nativeapp
2748	1	a	it would be nice if the driver returns correct size and position so that i dont have to guess and click through the tree to find an element
2754	1	a	user should be able to style the carousel items like we do for listviewitemslistboxitems
2755	1	a	user should be able to write style for all the viewstate like focused selected unselected normal etc
2756	1	a	we need a way to save documents generated and populated within our apps to pdf or xps
2760	1	a	it would be nice if there were an option somewhere where you could reboot your system straight into the bios menu
2771	1	a	please can someone implement this line of code and let me know if if is already working
2782	1	a	add shadow option to xaml ui elements
2792	1	a	please add bthprocolcap to allow us to use a lower implementation
2813	1	a	could you add support of xamarinforms to the project rome sdk
2865	1	a	so please before you completely remove suppresssystemoverlays make sure theres a way for us to force the status bar on and off even when we have entered full screen mode
2868	1	a	with suppresssystemoverlays you can still force the status bar to show using statusbarshowasync
2875	1	a	please provide with more information or planschedule
2876	1	a	release the sharedusercertificates for individual developers
2877	1	a	trigger animation based on scroll position or percentage while we scrollpan in uwp c like many web ui component as superscrollramajs
2879	1	a	since something like this would pretty much be aligned with the whole motion theme of the fluent design system i think it would be great if you could support it in future builds so we could use it with other composition apis to add new visual details and effects to our apps that are not possible at the moment
2882	1	a	bring rip silverlight deepzoom control to uwp control and pivotviewer too with wind capabilities
2883	1	a	my suggestionidea is to reduce the development time effort needed for aspnet web application
2886	1	a	typical problem here would be deploymentinstallationupdate of the ui application to client machine but if we simplify this process of deployment like having the rules that the ui app should be only one obfuscated executable file it should not depend on reference libraries
2889	1	a	this ui should get loaded on client machine as the user types in url in windows taskbar which has the search boxthus removing the dependency on browser for web applications
2890	1	a	the downloaded application should not be taking much space on user machine and it should not require installation and it should not require user to double click open but it should open as the user types the url in the search box in taskbar
2891	1	a	this ui application should have pure ui logic with all xaml files instead of html to support running on all devices and all os linuxwindows onwards
1	0	a	it seems storagefoldercreatefolder does not support multisegment path
4	0	a	windowssystemremotesystemsremotesystem does not provide meaningful data for xbox
6	0	a	and checking getcapabilitysupportedasync is always false for any known capability
7	0	a	when adding a statusfilter for available xbox is never shown
8	0	a	this makes it very hard to know upfront if the user can actually launch an uri on xbox because its totally unclear whether xbox is currently running or applications are allowed to run remotely
9	0	a	nevertheless if xbox is running and i use the remotelauncher the app is at least started correctly
12	0	a	the state is always unknown when the watcher triggers added or updated event
18	0	a	using send to compressed zip folder with files gb outputs nonisoconforming files which results in errors in many unzip softwares including unzip reference implementation from infoziporg as well as zip libarchive libzip and others
21	0	a	from the build windowsapplicationmodelappserviceappserviceconnectionopenasync consistently returns unknown error
22	0	a	ive tried this sample but not a luck
23	0	a	the unknown error also happens on build and i am curious is this just a bug or will this feature stop on future windows release
24	0	a	windows store policy for adult content
27	0	a	microsoft support working for report app are taking down apps which have partial but no nudity
29	0	a	game of thrones is on the windows store and contains full frontal nudity and graphic scenes so it is quite ridiculous when apps are removed that have partial nudity or body parts blurred out or covered
32	0	a	windows store policy for adult content
36	0	a	partial nudity is not pornographic nor sexually explicit
44	0	a	note that a windows forms implementation probably wont work because of deepseated incompatibilities in the windows forms architecture
45	0	a	a wpfonly solution is enough for me however
46	0	a	it is currently officially impossible to display the acrylic windowbackground effect in a nonuwp window
47	0	a	several developers have managed to coax out the private api used to implement this feature in a desktop app see however this api is officially unsupported can change at any time and has been changed in a backwardsincompatible manner once in the past
50	0	a	with the new windows ui library now in prerelease
51	0	a	are there plans to ensure new controls will be listed in the toolbox alongside the os based standard controls
52	0	a	will dragging from the toolbox automatically add the using markup to the page
53	0	a	will the blend features like isolated template editing be working
55	0	a	consistency could be ruined if every dev needs to handle manual markup especially as the ui toolkit iterates in the future
60	0	a	will the compact mode resource dictionary be bundled with the nuget package so it can be referenced in the app resources without having to ask developers to copy and paste xaml files
66	0	a	currently the manipulationdelta event args provides a single scale factor for pinchstretch events
68	0	a	its awkward to have different means of resizing objects
70	0	a	text boxes on the other hand have little handles attached to use for resizing
72	0	a	a dnssd service registration does not respond to mdns queries having a class of any but only responds to queries having a class of in
74	0	a	do stuff now that the service is registered
76	0	a	i have seen api recording and streaming and previewing the capture from the video
82	0	a	offcourse the api can throw commandnotfoundexception
91	0	a	currently it is unavailable in israel and cant compliment my already installed office and onedrive apps
92	0	a	charactercasing has been added to the platform but it seems to only be used on editable text controls
94	0	a	today we have the xdefaultbindmode attribute to define the default binding mode generated for a compiled data binding created with xbind
100	0	a	currently i can assign a license to all members of a group but it isnt kept up to date
101	0	a	i have a barcode scanner attached to my windows machine usb port
104	0	a	probably through a direct draw surfaces
106	0	a	without this information it will not be worthwhile for me to pursue the creation of a virtual reality system and with this information i can get the job done in a few days
107	0	a	there are design toolkits available for several designer programs at
114	0	a	now its readonly
119	0	a	windbg preview available for offline downloads
123	0	a	when typing in the whats new text area a message release notes cant be more than characters with a red x glyph appears when you reach characters
124	0	a	there is no actual error and submission completes
127	0	a	yellow exclamation
128	0	a	one keychain bluetooth chip inserted in a keychain for dynamic lock to pair included with software purchase and the option to purchase multiple keychains for each user
131	0	a	windows bit each window does not have maxmin buttons at the upper left hand corner for user functionality
132	0	a	point touch interface only in some applications gestures not functioning and no exit button to reach local environment
133	0	a	i understand this is an asus and microsoft concern and hope this evaluation helps in the next update
134	0	a	at build support between cortana and alexa was announced
137	0	a	i have built an app that targets windows and the customer is looking for a servicing fix on windows
138	0	a	i have got the fix ready but in order to produce a fix i need to be able to compile with the microsoft advertising sdk for windows xaml
139	0	a	is there anywhere i can find a copy and download it
142	0	a	i have included code to reproduce the issue
145	0	a	the issue seems to be somewhere in windowsuixamldlltextblockviewhelpersadjustpositionbycharactercount
146	0	a	it appears that garbage data from the stack i assume is being used for the value curinlinelength
147	0	a	call stack
148	0	a	is not news that window mobile wont have a chance against the major oss out in the market so i was thinking why try to implement something new when what is out there can be used for good on microsoft side
149	0	a	so this i have been thinking so far
150	0	a	microsoft have a good amount of apps on the google play store
151	0	a	they have a great launcher cortana outlook office for mobile and so on
157	0	a	how many consumers runs w on their pcs or laptops
168	0	a	the applicationviewmode compactoverlay also known as pictureinpicture minimode or alwaysontop for uwp apps has a maximum window size which seems to be a square with sides of approximately half screen height
170	0	a	unfortunately i can not since this is limited through windows
171	0	a	is there a good reason for this somehow arbitrary limit
176	0	a	its mini mode has exactly the same limitation
181	0	a	other than our product manager said pixels are a good maximum width and height for something called compact
187	0	a	previously it was possible to add an eventsetter to the datagridrows style as mentioned here but since eventsetter is now not apart of uwp i am left without this functionality
190	0	a	this already exists with the listview class which has a similar itemclicked event as an alternative to selectionchanged
192	0	a	this can become inefficient and somewhat confusing when users are able to select more than one items
197	0	a	this is helpful for layout debugging
199	0	a	suppose windows is misbehaving
201	0	a	suppose i want this to happen under program control
204	0	a	suppose i want it to be absolutely certain the video has not been monkeyed with
207	0	a	i can add only a style behavior or create a custom control for it
208	0	a	what do you prefer
209	0	a	could someone answer my question please
210	0	a	the windows bridge does not create a correct output files
212	0	a	i disabled the av the result is unsucceesful
213	0	a	what would i do
215	0	a	it looks like the bridge cannot remove its own folder while cleaning up the environment
217	0	a	i made a uwp app with a listview using keeplastiteminview
218	0	a	on many systems probably the slower ones the scrolling behavior is very odd
219	0	a	using the touchpadmousewheel the scrollbar starts moving but not the contents of the listview
221	0	a	i need to drag the scrollbar using the mouse to go the bottomtop of the listview
222	0	a	this behavior is not consistent
223	0	a	on other systems is works as expected
225	0	a	so they get stuck in all the networks devices cache and never go away
226	0	a	i have found other reports of people around the internet who have struggled with the same bug eg
229	0	a	i filed one against a microsoft example on github here
233	0	a	i am using microsofts dnssd which aims to implement the zeroconf standard rfc
234	0	a	i got nearly everything working except the case of finding all service types on the network using the service type servicesdnssdudp on the local domain
235	0	a	this is really useful for making debugging tools such as making a service discovery browser
236	0	a	i get no results when i try plugging servicesdnssdudp
238	0	a	you can see this for the summary on this feature here or in the rfc
240	0	a	for comparison ive tested this on bonjour avahi and androids network service discovery and they all handle this case correctly
241	0	a	first is there any way to get this to work
245	0	a	im using the microsoft example found here
249	0	a	find all service types does not work
257	0	a	for comparison ive more
259	0	a	that was a very good build
263	0	a	template has a loading busy page that has this functionality
264	0	a	the existing color picker have a very long height
266	0	a	i know this will be simple just edit the style but i cant make it right
268	0	a	when dropping appx bundles onto the drop target the page takes a long time to respond
269	0	a	because the page doesnt change to reflect the drop operation was successful i inadvertently drop multiple packages onto the target wasting my time and bandwidth
271	0	a	as a developer i am always in the dev dashboard
272	0	a	despite being built to appear as a singlepage app clicking pretty much any link in dev dashboard will result in an entire reload of the page to include navigation bars and columns
274	0	a	this behavior makes quick health checks and submissions nearly impossible
275	0	a	i now avoid logging in until absolutely required
277	0	a	i cant delete or hide them in the dashboard
278	0	a	this eats up screen real estate and impacts load times
279	0	a	i contacted support and they cant delete them either srxid
280	0	a	as a developer that has to stay on top of feedback i receive feedback from users around the world
282	0	a	i cannot delete this feedback
283	0	a	this clutters up my feedback interface and impacts load times
284	0	a	i contacted support and they cant delete it either srxid
285	0	a	as a developer i manage customer groups for package flighting and customer segmentation
286	0	a	when i am done using a customer group i cannot delete or hide it
288	0	a	unused groups eat up screen estate and impact load time of the page
289	0	a	as a developer i create submissions for my apps
291	0	a	in the age ratings area i am told my current rating id is ccbbeeddfe
292	0	a	i dont know what that means
293	0	a	i hope its right
296	0	a	this screws up my group metrics eg count and makes it annoying when sending out email blasts commercial providers use recipients as a metric for billing
299	0	a	when i click a customer group to manage it opens in a new window unlike most of the other links in the dashboard
300	0	a	this may seem minor but its a huge irritant
301	0	a	death by a thousand cuts
303	0	a	this data is critical to resolving customer issues
308	0	a	note you cannot see filesimages attached to the item
309	0	a	bonus you cant delete this feedback
310	0	a	when a machine automatically reboots as part of installing updates any running apps are closed
312	0	a	a small number of nonuwp desktop apps do this but rely on service components to trigger restarting the app which is undesirable in a modernuwp environment
316	0	a	im aware that theres some potential overlap here with proposed timeline and sets functionality which allows people to continue where they left off but this request is specifically focused on what happens when the computer restarts without interaction when the user is away from the device
330	0	a	this violates developer expectations
331	0	a	since the semanticzoom is subscribed to the backrequested event if i navigate to another page and press the back button the backrequested event is not called on my navigated page since it is handled by the semanticzoom in the previous page even if page caching is disabled for the frame
334	0	a	everytime i open a uwp app both xpadder and the app recognize input thus doubling the signal
336	0	a	even the hamburger button does not work properly when using extended view and collapsed back button
338	0	a	the hamburger button is on the side of the back button
341	0	a	up to date with win pro build rs insider slow ring and no corresponding desktop app converter base image uploaded
343	0	a	what is wrong
345	0	a	compilation fails with error cs in mainpagegcs mainpagemainpageobjbindings does not contain a definition for bindingstracking and no extension method bindingstracking accepting a first argument of type mainpagemainpageobjbindings could be found
346	0	a	this is the same error that was marked completed here
349	0	a	i assume the tool is at most meg
350	0	a	apparently i need to download gigs worth of sdk just to get that one file
351	0	a	windows media player can play mid files for a very long time but groove music app cannot because winrt does not have api to play midi file
355	0	a	forcing us to restart
357	0	a	please with any humanity in you
359	0	a	getting version and changelog info in microsoft store on windows is way to hard
360	0	a	i find that its really well hidden sometimes i cant find it at all
361	0	a	take spotify for instance
362	0	a	all i find is initial release date
364	0	a	i want to know what date it was updates what version number it currently has and weather the developer provided a changelog
366	0	a	i have a scenario when my user wants to sign into two different accounts
368	0	a	it logs off account when logging into account
369	0	a	api uses a webviewbased auth
371	0	a	there are a lot of mssettings commands to launch different settings pages from code on hololens but there is no way to call the utilities page under the sysem settings
373	0	a	our primary uwp app is currently compiled as x only because there are some limitations of c libs we use
374	0	a	weve discovered just today that webgl does not work in webview in uwp apps compiled as x on windows
377	0	a	when using menyflyoutshowatframeworkelement point with menuflyoutpresenter style with rounded corners or other semitransparency unwanted white background is shown under it in windows
378	0	a	this was not happening before on windows or earlier
379	0	a	our app is using menuflyout with shadow effect a lot so its causing us lot of headache right now
382	0	a	mouse sensors and other similar harware devices
383	0	a	for user the sensors are the different places and ways to touch in space having xyz coordinates like
385	0	a	this is the second question with kind of hardware device is use to
388	0	a	and when you type glyphuri in the vs xaml editor and type equal sign it pops up an opinions menu to open a fonticon wizard
390	0	a	when you select either on it automtically adds the font to a folder under your project called fonts that you can specify using a msappx resource path
398	0	a	the document said that occurs when the user invokes the system button for close the x button in the corner of the apps title bar
399	0	a	but when user tapping x button on sets window the event not raised correctly
402	0	a	because a lot of user post a bug report to the app review on the microsoft store
415	0	a	the launchuriforresultsasync method works fine
416	0	a	but we cant change the size of the window that is opened
419	0	a	this prevents us from using this api
421	0	a	when running a uwp app on win desktop i am able to add two timedtextcues to a timedmetadatatrack with the same starttime but on mobile it results in a crash
422	0	a	im guessing this is a bug because it doesnt produce an understandable exception
423	0	a	if i add the cues to the track before adding the track to mediasourceexternaltimedmetadatatracks the crash happens when adding the track
429	0	a	i reproduced this on mobile emulator wxga inch gb and on a lumia running
438	0	a	comment lines from to where serial device settins read
446	0	a	connect to port and try to send data to it
447	0	a	you will see that await loadasynctask never ends
449	0	a	the last three days i was working hard to solve a problem submitting our uwp app to the store
450	0	a	now i know why it was not working and i want to make my knowledge public
453	0	a	we have an uwp app targeting windows fall creators update which was published successfully to the sore previously
454	0	a	a new version fails the certification process with app crash or freeze
456	0	a	side loadable release builds are also starting and working on our build and test machines
458	0	a	this package contains our code compiled with the native tool chain
459	0	a	but the appxbundle package extracted from the appxupload this is the zipfile uploaded to the store fails at startup after it was side loaded on my test machine
460	0	a	for side loading you need to install the cer file contained in the apppackagesappnameversiontest folder to your system cert store unter trusted roots ok something must be wrong with the uploaded appxupload package
463	0	a	this package does always crash after side loading it
464	0	a	so this crash is not the problem reported by the certification process
465	0	a	now things are very complicated
466	0	a	the uploaded appxupload package contains the net dlls which are compiled via the native tool chain on the microsoft certification server which generates a package which fails at startup
468	0	a	unfortunately there are no more details available from the certification process
469	0	a	also microsoft support could not help me
470	0	a	they build a package which fails without details and i can not download the build package for debugging
474	0	a	fortunately it does not try to start the build as part of the certification process
475	0	a	so i was able to install the test flight package on my local machine for debugging
478	0	a	using some gflags and vs i was able to find that the entry point for formatmessage was not found
480	0	a	the problem here was that for some vs releases the cprogram files xwindows kitsapp certification kitsupportedapisx
481	0	a	xml file contains some entry point definitions for formatmessage which does not exist
482	0	a	so the native tool chain compiles against the wrong entry point which causes the app crash at startup
483	0	a	but why was it working on my local machine
484	0	a	this is because i am using visual studio which has already fixed the problem
485	0	a	unfortunately the build infrastructure of microsoft which is used for the uwp certification process at least for our targeted os version windows falls creators update uses the buggy version of the supportedapisx
487	0	a	after i used the latest version of pinvokekerneldll which contains a workaround for the problem all was fine
492	0	a	local release builds created with the native toolchain of vs are working
493	0	a	here the supportedapisx
496	0	a	xml for their build environment
498	0	a	i hope this helps

618	0	a	i experienced problem with uwp listview particularly using isupportincrementalloading interface as a datasource
619	0	a	a few words about problem context
620	0	a	in our uwp app there is a listview and it uses isupportincrementalloading as a datasource
621	0	a	and while next part of data is loading listview is disabled
622	0	a	so the problem in that if you scroll listview in way you catch scrollbar and pull it to the down
623	0	a	when you scroll to the end of the list listview will be disabled for some period of time while data is loading
624	0	a	and if you release mouse button from scrollbar
626	0	a	you cannot hover mouse on scrollbar because when try to do it scrollbar goes upper

1191	0	a	it is understandable that when uwp app is run normally it can only access a limited set of com objects however if the uwp is packaged to desktop bridge it makes sense to allow it to access additional com objects exposed by that desktop bridge using the technical described in the blog above
1194	0	a	we are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated xbox apps
1195	0	a	it used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on xbox which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high
1196	0	a	now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on xbox and by default every windows app that is published is published on all devices
1199	0	a	it is totally crazy and really counterproductive to building any kind of a vibrant ecosystem
1200	0	a	one simple example is there is a pdf database app on the new apps list on xbox
1201	0	a	you cannot use it it cannot access files and it has absolutely no viable function on xbox one
1202	0	a	yet somehow this passes certification and is thrown on the pile of rubbish that now clutters the new app section
1204	0	a	it is hugely frustrating to put months of work into building an app for xbox and stand no chance of getting it downloaded because nobody will ever be able to find it

1249	0	a	please fix this annoying issue

1276	0	a	this is only available for wpf
1277	0	a	here are some examples
1285	0	a	right now its possible to define apps for websites using app uri handlers
1287	0	a	these excludepaths feature supports only path matching right now not wildcards for the whole uri
1290	0	a	uwp combobox is not showing the selected value under certain resolutions
1292	0	a	in visual studio if i select the container a grid and change something like the flow from horizontal to vertical the redraw fixes the issue which leads me to believe that its the render
1293	0	a	we use the create date on log files to check if they can be deleted
1294	0	a	the problem is that when we delete that file and recreate it same filename the create date stays the same
1301	0	a	run the code again
1304	0	a	the testlog file is created again
1307	0	a	it should have been or later
1308	0	a	run this as many times as you like the create date will not change from the first time you ran the code
1313	0	a	how to reproduce
1319	0	a	it deletes the file
1325	0	a	having sockseqpacket would remove the burden of distinguishing between independent messages from the user
1329	0	a	some users certainly will find this useful
1331	0	a	sadly if youre someone who finds this annoying theres no option to disable this behavior
1332	0	a	according to the singular post i was able to find on this new feature there is no way to disable this
1341	0	a	it currently only supports octetstream
1348	0	a	actually we cant because the same notification would be send too if the user is closing the application
1352	0	a	this issue was reported for visual studio feedback site but they have determined that this issue belongs to universal windows platform
1355	0	a	its tooo painful
1358	0	a	uservoice already have it
1365	0	a	this works as expected on phones but not on computerstablets
1366	0	a	im using fall creators update not sure how it behaves in other versions
1368	0	a	in my case i am writing an app where you learn how to spell and dont want to give the user any hints
1369	0	a	create a new blank uwp application and add this xaml code
1371	0	a	when i run this i expect to get no suggestions in the software keyboard when writing anything in the text box
1376	0	a	we are developing components on linux which has dedicated system call and memory requests
1377	0	a	afunix ancillary mmap and many others within docker
1378	0	a	this would signify communication and access on the file system
1381	0	a	i have some more feature recommendations regarding extensions in adaptivegridview if you will
1384	0	a	and which operator to use andor in case of multiple property filter provided
1386	0	a	and this grouping will obviously include the semantic zoom feature as well
1387	0	a	incremental loading i know this is already in the community toolkit
1389	0	a	sorting sorting with or more properties
1391	0	a	these are some of the most common scenarios which are required by developers and there are many ways to do it but this can get very complicated to align them with best practices
1397	0	a	this search bar auto filters the items on basis of the filterdescriptor provided filter descriptor can be defined by the developer tht which stringtimeint property to match with which condition ie contains startswith endswith etc
1402	0	a	we also use multipletoplevel windows that are already available
1405	0	a	i have a disk imaging which i have already converted application that writes bytes directly to disk usb and sd cards
1407	0	a	the app gets rejected during submission to the store as some features are disabled as admin privileges are required
1411	0	a	so in a round about way youre actually raising the chances of users getting viruses by blocking these apps as they just get them from the web instead
1428	0	a	current clipboard api can notify about a clipboard content change which is fine
1429	0	a	but getting or setting the content doesnt work if the app is in background or unfocused
1435	0	a	if this is a privacy constraint then more
1437	0	a	currently the input will be validated if the focus of the textbox lost
1443	0	a	it is possible for us to get a dddevice from mediastreamsource as indicated by admins here
1445	0	a	i can verify that this works
1446	0	a	but unfortunately it is not possible to create a mediastreamsample from dd surface
1450	0	a	xbind is great and i love it
1454	0	a	this limit is not in the emailmessage documentation
1456	0	a	this limit appears to be arbitrary and not on par with other platforms ios android mac osx
1457	0	a	this limitation is a contribution to a diminished user experience and developer experience when compared to these other platforms
1459	0	a	this idea is so bad on so many levels
1460	0	a	so what is the suggestion
1463	0	a	as a xamarinforms developer i had to drill down frameworks to find this limitation
1466	0	a	especially if that steam roller is riddled with security issues and complexity way beyond the experience and latitude of most fly swatter users
1467	0	a	in this following forum post the character limit for an email body generated via code from an app is noted
1476	0	a	contentdialog is currently far too difficult to use for two reasons locking and placement
1482	0	a	this means that contentdialogshowasync will wait until any currentlydisplayed contentdialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog
1487	0	a	on the other hand if showasync contentdialogplacementinplace is used then a it is not convenient because one must separately embed the dialog in xaml and b it doesnt always work because an exception occurs if showasyncinplace is called on the dialog before the xaml is fully loaded
1505	0	a	passwordvaultfindallbyresource throws a comexception when there are no credentials for the resource or maybe only when there are no credentials
1507	0	a	right now the windowclosed event for desktop fires both for minimization and for closing events
1510	0	a	a good web example can be found here
1512	0	a	we are able to download previous versions of the release versions of the windows sdk
1514	0	a	on the slow ring we are currently on windows build but the only sdk download link provided on the windows insider download page is for at time of writing
1515	0	a	i am not willing to go to fast ring because this renders my laptop useless
1518	0	a	when you invoke the primary or secondary buttons in a contentdialog you are not losing focus in the control that was last being edited
1520	0	a	ive tried forcing the control in this case a textbox to lose focus programmatically in the primary buttonevent handler but this does not help
1521	0	a	ive also tried bindingsupdate bit this does not help either
1524	0	a	if you are using xbind to bind that controls value to a property in the contentdialog codebehind page then when you press the primary button the property doesnt get updated
1527	0	a	the expected behaviour is that when you click on the primary more

1530	0	a	there are thousands of programmists here too
1531	0	a	currently there does not appear to be a way to set a windows startup position left top widthright heightbottom beyond fullscreen andor maximized
1532	0	a	also the last used position for a given window isnt saved intrinsically
1533	0	a	windows launch at random places on the desktop
1534	0	a	i understand this need does not really exist for mobile
1535	0	a	but for many desktop applications specifically container applications managing windows is a core feature objective
1536	0	a	it is similar like this issue
1537	0	a	weve inherit a control from slider and put it in horizontal
1539	0	a	our app would crash
1540	0	a	if we use applicationexecutablepath when the user open the shortcut he gets an access permission error so i am trying to create it using shellappsfolder but i cant get the appusermodelid
1541	0	a	im on a desktopbridge app and when i try to use windowsapplicationmodelappinfo its null
1544	0	a	setting protextedtext to on doesnt work the selected text is still modifiable
1547	0	a	editor is the value of xname given to richeditbox element
1550	0	a	rotatortiles behavior is like an automated flipview
1553	0	a	microsoft has added in the camera app the panorama mode which works in some devices and tablets
1554	0	a	dont know if it is a specific number of devices that currently this feature works
1565	0	a	dont want a solution with the scrollviewer and the compass because i have already done that
1567	0	a	convert exe to appx by command lines
1571	0	a	its century
1573	0	a	but the uwp textboxes are not that god when it comes to numeric input
1574	0	a	im currently working on a software that has a lot of numeric input
1578	0	a	only allows numeric input
1591	0	a	if the user enters a value less than the min value the value will be updated to min value on lost focus
1607	0	a	format numbers with commas on thousands ie
1613	0	a	the same with old stlye binding works fine
1614	0	a	comparison results with edge on the right
1618	0	a	app tested is webview release
1621	0	a	even rendering on separate thread will block ui thread for example reveal highlight effect while bigger page is loading or typing into textbox will lag while javascript in the page is running
1623	0	a	currently it is impossible to implement context menus save files and implement other functions general web browsers have
1626	0	a	eg represents the isupsup c controller for the system
1627	0	a	every modern operating system on this planet uses lf style line endings except for windows which still writes one more useless byte at every end of a line

1668	0	a	for instance when running my app on the hololens it applies a scale factor
1669	0	a	this means the ui looks squished when compare to a desktop screen of a similar resolution x
1676	0	a	say you have two menu items one home and the other whatever
1678	0	a	theres no sane way to do it eg
1679	0	a	a cancel boolean on the event args of the iteminvoked event
1680	0	a	an example for this would be this budgeting app i am currently working on
1684	0	a	thanks for considering changing this
1686	0	a	say you throw up a message box a la do you want to save the changes yesnocancel if you were to click cancel theres no way to prevent the navigationview to follow through with it visually
1690	0	a	in my opinion uwp is too much app centric
1692	0	a	in the health page of dev center analytics crashes and hangs can be filtered by os version rtm etc
1695	0	a	while i get crashes by os health page i need to crossreference this with usage by os to determine the overall impact of a given bug
1699	0	a	this application is far too complex for mobile screens and x is too small

1804	0	a	is there some sort of bug tracker for microsoft software
1805	0	a	kinda like uservoice but for bug reports
1806	0	a	i have an app that works normally but when launched via the desktop bridge theres some strange issues with com
1807	0	a	what does the desktop bridge do differently
1810	0	a	coreapplication now has a requestrestartasync method but it fails in a desktop bridge app with notinforeground
1814	0	a	any ideas on how i can cause the app to restart
1816	0	a	however collapsing a pivot item does not remove it from the ui visual tree
1818	0	a	since you can correctly hide listboxitems i am considering this a bug
1820	0	a	repeatedly calling mediaplayerstepforwardoneframe mediaplayerstepbackoneframe should switch between two frames but video is moving slightly back
1823	0	a	at first this isnt an issue since the control isnt visible
1824	0	a	however if you make the parent visible binding will not be triggered and you must manually force an update to get bound values to appear
1825	0	a	this was probably done as a performance optimization however binding needs to recognize visibility changes if it wont bind when an item is not visible in the ui
1826	0	a	otherwise yet again mvvm is broken
1827	0	a	i have a uwp usercontrol line chart that renders a pathfigure to a canvas
1829	0	a	at high zoom levels above the entire uwp app will crash with a native exception an unhandled win exception occured in app
1832	0	a	this crash only happens using the fall creators update after the clipping issue was fixed
1833	0	a	im guessing its a numerical overflow somewhere deep in the graphics stack
1835	0	a	this chart supports zooming and the pathfigure size is changed during zoom but clipped within the visible chart area
1838	0	a	there must be a bug some place in the framework

1867	0	a	in stack overflow or any other forums we have option to add multiple tags related to our question
1868	0	a	currently is not possibile to create a new calendar inside an enterprise exchange user account
1869	0	a	its only allowed to create an app calendar which lives on local device
1874	0	a	at the moment a vsto addin cannot be published on windows store or on office store
1875	0	a	an idea could be extending desktop app converter tool in order to manage vsto addin
1877	0	a	i reported that since studio the designer crash due to attached properties
1893	0	a	however when using the result in a dragdrop or clipboard operation windows explorer errors out with x no such interface supported
1894	0	a	it can be used between uwp apps but not in windows explorer which really is a shame
1895	0	a	there are desktop win apis for delay creation of files that are used heavily eg
1896	0	a	in winzip and similar applications to delay actual unzip of files until really required but they cannot be used in uwp
1899	0	a	things like minconnectioninterval maxconnectioninterval slavelatency and connection supervisory timeout
1901	0	a	it is a compendium of various pdf viewer tutorials rolled into a single user control
1908	0	a	this of course can already be found in wpf any for any developers who want to migrate their classic desktop app to uwp this would be a big boost
1922	0	a	so at the moment i have to tell my customers open the folderpicker and navigate from the pictureslibrary to the pathdvery long pathfinalfolder
1925	0	a	actual implementing an selection of file or folder in uwp how easy but stupid
1932	0	a	so pickersuggestedstartlocation is not a string to a path but only a selection of libraries
1934	0	a	now after the great windows fall creators update it is still a joke to switch and develop to uwp
1936	0	a	does anybody at ms have an idea how to propose an path in an uwp application
1937	0	a	under uwp it is still not possible to open a folder or file out of the sandbox
1941	0	a	and thereby the folderpicker has no preview to the content in a folder
1942	0	a	so this is now in after the great fall creators update still a ridiculous status of the great iniative change to more
1943	0	a	well currently i have a uwp app that needs to call a webapi service that is secured with azure ad
1944	0	a	i have been looking for samples and tutorials to do this and i have found some
1945	0	a	but they all differ in what to do exactly
1959	0	a	for example a long running task where the user is not allowed to back out until it completes
1966	0	a	am even stock now i would be glad if you can update it now
1971	0	a	i need a similar feature for uwp
1972	0	a	there are several issues with the file activation neighboringfilesquery argument and the file system indexer
1974	0	a	if files are loaded using the neighboringfilesquery then getpropertiesasync on those files will only return properties that have been indexed
1975	0	a	this prevents reading things like altitude from the gps location data
1977	0	a	the above is made a lot worse on computers where indexing file content is disabled right click on the drive in explorer select properties and see check box at the bottom which used to be recommended for ssd drives
1978	0	a	in particular no imageproperties are available in this case
1981	0	a	if the indexer is really broken for some reason this started happening on my computer so is not uncommon then it will fail to pick up any neighboring files at all confirmed by using the default photos app to open a photo in a folder with lots of photos and it only showed one photo
1984	0	a	i dont think this is a security issue because the data is in the file and the file contents are readable
1998	0	a	when setting tooltipserviceplacement to mouse the text in the tooltip is no longer sharp
1999	0	a	it looks like the tooltip is not perfectly aligned to the device pixels but rather half a pixel off vertically
2000	0	a	this is on windows fall creators update build dpi scale the app targets windows sdk
2011	0	a	example open the mailapp write the mail content with the pen directly on the richeditbox canvas text gets recognised boom done
2013	0	a	the way ink input is currently handled is sooo win i know there is inkcanvas and windowsuiinputinkinganalysis put this should be build into the text controls in a standard more
2014	0	a	currently in masterview we can only use listview
2015	0	a	it limits the use case of masterview
2016	0	a	we cant use pivot semantic zoom gridview pulltorefresh slidablelistitem and more
2019	0	a	then devs can use connected animations
2020	0	a	i upgraded to the latest vs and change my uwp app to use netnative
2021	0	a	it now gets a number of linker problems that are being caused by microsoft components
2029	0	a	i dont call this function
2030	0	a	when i traced down some new crashes i found that socketconnectasync is trying to call this function and failing because it doesnt exist
2031	0	a	i have about similar errors in the build that are referencing things i dont directly call
2032	0	a	ive reverted to netnative until this gets fixed
2038	0	a	calling this method would throw exception at runtime
2044	0	a	in windows forms toolkit there is a handy control called the numericupdowncontrol
2049	0	a	calendarview control that consumes the calendarmonthview
2051	0	a	calendarview supports arrows that appear when hovered allowing mouse users to switch months
2052	0	a	calendarview supports mouse scroll to switch months
2062	0	a	current appextension only supports loading assets and scripts
2064	0	a	there may be trusting problems
2066	0	a	repro project
2067	0	a	we are experiencing an issue where the presence of a passwordbox with a numericpin inputscope overrides the inputscope of other controls on the pageuntil the passwordbox has received focus
2068	0	a	on a touch screen this manifests every time a user reaches the first page in our uwp app that has a numericpinscoped passwordbox
2072	0	a	build and run the app
2078	0	a	keyboard remains numericpin
2080	0	a	see that the inputscopes of the textboxes are now honored
2096	0	a	before doing anything else click the show touch keyboard button in the notification tray such that the touch keyboard appears
2098	0	a	i think i found a problem in media player
2100	0	a	in this case will be fired only mediaplayerplaybacksessionplaybackstatechanged event and it is not possible to detect whether app was paused through user or system
2101	0	a	but if phone calls then will be simulated systemmediatransportcontrols pause button click mediaplayersystemmediatransportcontrolsbuttonpressed event and on phone call i can correctly stop my player and change some states
2107	0	a	ive looked into using a softwarebitmapsource instead but this is a lot slower and uses more memory and i am not sure whether its dispose method works doesnt affect memory shown in vs debugger but did seem to have an effect when testing using a mobile emulator
2109	0	a	i am preloading images for speed and i need to release the memory immediately when no longer needed to prevent memory failures but setting the reference to null and even calling gccollect immediately does not always result in an immediate release of memory
2111	0	a	compact overlay window is always shown at the righttop corner
2116	0	a	this would help in hit testing of visuals
2117	0	a	more details can be found in this issue
2119	0	a	we can see the support of communities in uwpcommunitytoolkit
2121	0	a	as a selflearner it is very hard to find a tutorial to learn new things
2124	0	a	i hear a lot about clean uninstall but we noticed a few months ago appx leaves some stuff behind
2125	0	a	specifically persisted appframe window sizing data remains behind potentially leaving the userdev in a potential bad or confusing window state
2126	0	a	see the data piling up in the following stores
2130	0	a	a lot of small time developers like myself dont have the means to use the microsoft store to host their apps
2131	0	a	i develop applications for the military and the it department barely has any idea what theyre doing
2133	0	a	win apps still dominate because theyre so robust and developed
2139	0	a	to bring in new and old developers bring back the same functionality that is found in wpf more
2153	0	a	and not calling setdesiredbounds
2154	0	a	this is what the screen looks like
2155	0	a	sorry for the photo could not do a regular screen shot at the moment
2157	0	a	yes video and transport controls cover the entire media player
2159	0	a	in full screen transport controls not video do also respect the safe area
2164	0	a	otherwise this looks cut and incomplete
2165	0	a	nevertheless so far this is ok and could be called as expected
2169	0	a	the safe area is removed and it looks like the following
2171	0	a	page has no more safe area but on the transport controls have suddenly the safe area even though the media player is part within the page
2172	0	a	for full screen it remains the same framed version as before so no additional screen shot why are transport controls no longer covering the entire video
2174	0	a	thats an real issue
2175	0	a	i am removing the safe area by calling setdesiredbounds and i am experiencing framed transport controls then even when using as control somewhere within the page
2177	0	a	i debugged this a lot and found a solution and realized a very dirty hack by microsoft
2178	0	a	in my app i am using custom transport controls and i used the original template as a starting point
2180	0	a	this is documented nowhere and has the bad effect described above
2182	0	a	nevertheless i would expect a less hacky solution
2185	0	a	and fiddling arround with a grid by name is just a dirty hack since this does not work with custom transport controls as long as the magic grid with its name is not present
2198	0	a	but when we play a video file using mediastreamsource it is not possible to pass through the subtitle streams because we cannot create mediastreamdescriptors for them
2199	0	a	so audio and video works but subtitles dont work
2202	0	a	i am unable to use containers and vmwarevirtualbox on windows at the same time due to the restriction of hyperv
2203	0	a	this restriction does not exist on linux and macos
2207	0	a	it doesnt seem to quite have an equivalent in uwp in order to get even spacing of a grid automatically as well as other features like setting rowscolumns and first column for calendar type applications
2223	0	a	a previous uservoice api to control screen brightness was marked closed after creators update with brightness control being introduced
2224	0	a	brightnessoverride would fit the purpose except it requires iot embedded mode and therefore cannot use this api
2226	0	a	apple announced support for fragmented mp backed hls streams under hls version at wwdc
2227	0	a	we are looking to change the way our hls streams are generated and windows seems to be one of the few platforms that doesnt support playing these type of streams
2230	0	a	if the datatemplate xdatatypemodelslocalstatus references poco class that is in a seperate project the xaml will not compile
2232	0	a	i submitted this to the vs forum but they said to post the issue here
2239	0	a	we now have this option for listview and gridview but not for the combobox control
2241	0	a	the streamsocket class has no good way of polling the connection status without sending data your connection may have died minutes ago but you wont know until you try to send something which isnt desirable
2243	0	a	the proposal is to add something like
2246	0	a	something happened update your ui or run your business logic

2256	0	a	or you display search results for various item types in one view
2258	0	a	but it causes a context switch from nativenet and back for each item which will slow down the control when showing a lot of items this is noticeable on slow devices or phones

2326	0	a	as per the dev center has support to monitor crash reports for native win desktop apps without publishing into the store
2327	0	a	but i couldnt find any option in my dev center account to support this functionality
2329	0	a	however the api was designed that it will introduce severe overhead in the following scenario

2332	0	a	lets assume i have objects which are soft particles sp
2333	0	a	and objects that are triangle meshes tm
2334	0	a	both sp and tm use alpha blending
2335	0	a	sp dont do depth writes but they do depthtests and depth reads in the shader
2339	0	a	so both sp and tm do legal operations they dont write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time

2801	0	a	for large teams just having one team member being able to do this is a bad design decision
2802	0	a	the api is fine but where i am running into trouble is that things like flyouts and dialogs intercept any and all access to the event
2803	0	a	event registration order doesnt seem to make a difference

2860	0	a	the information in the status bar is highly relevant to a video app
2863	0	a	sure we could replace the status bar with our own ui containing the same info
2871	0	a	when the user starts video playback on a phone we use suppresssystemoverlays to hide the navigation bar on devices such as lumia that has them more
2872	0	a	it seems its still not possible to submit edge extensions to the store

2960	0	a	native support of svg animation with smil inside xaml for beautiful and responsive ui and hardware acceleration backend on opengldirectdvulkanmetal
2961	0	a	the advantage of xaml to natively support svg with smil is that you as a developer would not have to worry about these icons and animations the design or animator could do that in other software and deliver svgs to you
2966	0	a	in addition to being able to search on the internet svg animated icons ready to use
2968	0	a	these are widely used in the real world today

2992	0	a	the backgroundtasks can currently be launched every minutes by the timetrigger
2993	0	a	unfortunately if a task is launched via this timetrigger but appears idle to the operating system then it is suspended
2994	0	a	this means the task can not execute for the full minute window
2998	0	a	my current backgroundtask has a timer in it which would allow my background task to wake up on a timer event periodically do some processing then wait again
2999	0	a	this low amount of processing looks to be idle so gets suspended

3043	0	a	also ive followed your links and it really sounds awfully complicated honestly i dont know where to start
3046	0	a	for example i drag and drop cfolderimagebmp file onto my app window and my app will generate cfolderimagepng so what i need is a simple api like void onfilesdroppedstring filenames int windowclientposx int windowclientposy where filenames is an array of full path names of all filesfolders drag and dropped onto the app and other parameters are the xy coordinates of the client window position where the drag and drop occured

3072	0	a	in vsync mode ive cleared it more times to get below fps limit
3074	0	a	why are you limiting uwp and directx to flip mode that is slower
3081	0	a	while bc is great the bc quality is not really good however we still need small size for textures as my game is currently over gb of texture data
3084	0	a	what happened to astc texture format
3085	0	a	originally this was supposed to be included in directx but later was scrapped
3086	0	a	are we going to see it eventually
3087	0	a	currently i am using only texture formats
3092	0	a	if you have relocated your user folder somewhere else and the older downloads folder remains if you add the old storagefolder to the storageapplicationpermissionsfutureaccesslist
3094	0	a	currently it is really painful to add new controls from newer windows sdk versions to apps and still support older versions
3096	0	a	ways this could potentially be fixed
3100	0	a	this would be really helpful when it comes to upcoming fluent design supporting new fluent design styles and supporting the design waves
3107	0	a	like how xamarinforms does it instead of more
3110	0	a	i am especially interested in how this would work for my app to span different hardware types regardless of form factor or os the idea of a seamless experience between windows desktop and android or ios mobile is compelling but i need to see some examples before i invest
3112	0	a	ive read about project rome and the possibility of creating crossdevice experiences and am particularly interested in the project rome android sdk
3117	0	a	a it is extremely slow
3119	0	a	b it draws mappolygons blurred with jagged borders
3120	0	a	c it draws mappolylines in wrong positions very very often
3121	0	a	they take right position then after manual shifting of map but initially of them are misplaced after being added to mapelements collection
3122	0	a	most often it occurs near map borders
3130	0	a	the sdk itself support the sidebyside installation then we can try the new api with our uwp apps
3131	0	a	but there are no way to distribute this kind of app to testers or customers that use win insider preview
3132	0	a	it only allow the customer update sdk level
3134	0	a	you know many of microsoft apps are updated with new sdk and itll be available at the store during insider preview
3136	0	a	for example ms provide the lot of sdk and new technologies about win fall cu
3147	0	a	this is really a must for apps that target businesses or wishmust to support older devices that will not get the latest versions
3149	0	a	uwp media element or mediaplayerelement are fantastic with uibut their codecs to play different kinds of audio and video files is very limited
3151	0	a	thankyou
3166	0	a	how can we ensure registration is complete for the com server without adding regsvr command in post build and setting linker value for register output to false
3168	0	a	we see an error classnotregistered message
3169	0	a	saw the same issue with client app in packagedcomserver sample with those settings changed
3171	0	a	link to the sample
3181	0	a	now i can create an attached property and assume it is already false and set that to the default however if i would like to check beforehand if the more
3185	0	a	microsoft ime and justsystems atok work fine
3187	0	a	of course win apps and uwp apps can use goggle ime
3190	0	a	it scanned my entire computer for certification way outside the scope of building a uwp application
3191	0	a	it took an hour just to get through my steam library
3192	0	a	cortana for windows iot core only supports english
3195	0	a	ability to provide powerful animations in markup
3198	0	a	especially for stringformatconverter and formatstingconverter
3200	0	a	i have not found an easy way to download payout summary in an automated fashion
3201	0	a	probably not looked in the correct place yet
3202	0	a	even went so far as to chat and the rep indicate that this not currently supported
3203	0	a	this would be insane
3204	0	a	i have reported sales information from many other sources
3210	0	a	the webproxy property does not seem to have an impact on windows systems
3212	0	a	when i try to call launchuriasync or launchfileasync in tablet mode the calling app will not show on the top app is loading and goes to background
3213	0	a	i see only start menu tiles
3214	0	a	it hasnt to be a full fledged docking mdi control like the ones from
3217	0	a	it appears that the mapicon rendering by the mapcontrol has changed significantly with the windows creators update
3218	0	a	we have an app that at times adds hundreds of mapicon objects to the mapcontrol
3219	0	a	before creators update this worked fine and the vast majority if not all were displayed
3220	0	a	after creators update we are only seeing a small portion of the mapicon objects being rendered onto the map
3221	0	a	and its not because they are colliding with other mapicons
3222	0	a	we are seeing large portions of the map not displaying any of the mapicons weve added
3223	0	a	we have always been aware of the guidance that a mapicon is not guaranteed to be displayed but its never been a problem
3224	0	a	weve even tried setting mapelementcollisionbehaviorremainvisible but it doesnt make much difference
3225	0	a	it seems like theres now some sort of internal limit on how many mapicons are displayed at a time
3226	0	a	i couldnt find anything in the release notes about this change
3227	0	a	is this change in behavior expected or a bug
3235	0	a	the uwp scrollbar is white and is invisible on a light background
3236	0	a	it can only be seen on a dark background
3239	0	a	the skeleton tracking is not working on xbox
3241	0	a	mediaframesourcekindcustom is not available on the xbox
3242	0	a	it is available on the computer though
3252	0	a	as a result skeletal tracking apps do not work on the xbox platform
3254	0	a	the uwp application platform has a rich media api which allows querying of a video device eg
3255	0	a	the kinect and seeing if it supports things like exposurecontrol
3258	0	a	the autoexposure function causes major headaches for the app i am working on and i would dearly love to be able to turn it off
3260	0	a	ive noticed that when you create a datapackage containing both data provided directly lets say text using setdata and delayed formats like a bitmap using setdataprovider when closing the application the whole clipboard content is cleared
3262	0	a	in vs and maybe in the compiler raised a warning that we missed that stated some of our code was currently unsupported by the uwp toolchain
3263	0	a	this led to a runtime crash that took a long time to figure out
3266	0	a	warning sg cannot generate serialization code for type
3267	0	a	the methodname property of the knowntypeattribute on type objectmodelentitiesbasething is not currently supported
3272	0	a	like you are already doing with the xaml part the app is automatically reloaded without being shut down and relaunched
3274	0	a	it could save us developers a lot of time
3275	0	a	there is only one direction for the radial progress bar control clockwise
3281	0	a	but the xbox one doesnt provide any diagnostics data of apps eg
3282	0	a	memory cpu consumption etc
3283	0	a	there is a section for that in the device portal but there is currently not data
3286	0	a	users are asking me frequently for a xbox version of my app
3289	0	a	its just the same like with mobile
3290	0	a	here we have several emulators and i usually make use of them first instead of plugging a device immediately
3291	0	a	even more important xbox has a limited api with respect to desktop and mobile
3292	0	a	networkinformation object not available etc
3294	0	a	personally i wont enable xbox without having tested my app first at least in an emulator
3299	0	a	unfortunately i do not own a xbox nor would getting one make sense it is a free app so i am not really interested in spending lots of money just for developing purpose
3302	0	a	here we have several emulators and i usually make use of them first instead of more
3303	0	a	in windows messages for example there is a very nice control for enteringselecting contacts to send an email or text message etc to
3305	0	a	the control would include a field for required contactfieldtypes
3307	0	a	the fileopenpicker has the suggestedstartlocation and the official description of how it works is
3308	0	a	the suggestedstartlocation is not always used as the start location for the file picker
3312	0	a	in this situation suggestedstartlocation makes it more confusing because when the user tries to pick a music file the fileopenpicker is opening in the pictureslibrary
3317	0	a	so suggestedstartlocation remembers where you were and continues to open that same folder every time
3321	0	a	mobile phone cpu temperature
3322	0	a	i noticed this problem as soon as i adapted my app to use imageex
3323	0	a	i use an event to change opacity to once the image is loaded and sized and immediately i noticed that instead of just displaying the image faded in with a second animation
3324	0	a	this animation seems hardcoded into the style so to get rid of it i would have to redefine the style
3325	0	a	a real pain just to get rid of the animation
3337	0	a	one of the problems i encounter is my inability to get jack info as in iksjackdescriptiongetjackdescription
3338	0	a	i saw new post and i confirmed that the problem was fixed following url
3340	0	a	thanks for fixing an issue
3341	0	a	but i noticed that it still happens no sound issue in another situation
3342	0	a	ofcourse i am using windwos creators update version
3344	0	a	neither foreground nor fulltrustprocess
3345	0	a	it sounds normally after reboot os
3347	0	a	we have a very large wpf application built upon the virtual earth api with heavy customization of the rendering pipeline
3350	0	a	currently multiselectmodel does not work as documented
3351	0	a	player your app is activated one time
3352	0	a	all of the selected files are passed to your app as argument parameters
3353	0	a	as far as anniversary update and creators update are concerned multiselectmodel has no effect and only one file is passed as argument to the application regardless of how many files have been selected in explorer
3354	0	a	please support the passing of all selected files as command arguments
3355	0	a	all the documentation on how to call uwp methods are in c and require the net platform
3356	0	a	is there a lowlevel c interface as well
3358	0	a	many developer will be bringing java python etc applications to the windows store via the desktop bridge
3361	0	a	master panel in masterdetailsview was intended to be used as pulltorefreshlistview because usually the listview in master panel is dynamically changing it is often used for showing collections of emails articles etc
3363	0	a	it would save the user a lot of time and effort
3364	0	a	future access list is great in theory but adds too much overhead
3367	0	a	how uwp apps can compete with other systems with such things
3372	0	a	not mentioning that some kind of apps need more than file access why to give such a handicap for the whole platform
3375	0	a	btw seems that futureaccesslist sometimes has bugs and people are leaving platform and more
3376	0	a	make datatemplate behave like xamarinforms datatemplate class where you have constructors
3379	0	a	datatemplatefuncobject this one provides lot of flexibility
3380	0	a	the windows store analytics api is great
3383	0	a	the most important data is the conversions breakdown by campaign id table at the bottom of the page
3384	0	a	currently uwp cant open wasapi output devices in capture mode due to com restrictions
3385	0	a	this means loopback auto capture is not supported
3392	0	a	until now i cant find any api or documents about this
3393	0	a	we have a mediaplayer that works with onedrive mkv streams in previous versions but not in creators update
3395	0	a	player raises sourcenotsupported error
3397	0	a	now that the markdowntextblock control supports fenced code blocks in version languagespecific syntax highlighting would be the next step eg
3399	0	a	but that would be beyond what the control should do in terms of separation of concerns
3401	0	a	the function would get the original text and is expected to return either xaml objects or maybe a more abstract of representation of colored text which is then handled by the control
3406	0	a	the function would get the original text and is expected to return either xaml objects or maybe a more abstract of representation of colored text which is then handled by more
3409	0	a	im talking about this website
3411	0	a	the problem is it always provides the latest version only
3414	0	a	this is really important not only for menus toolbar buttons
3415	0	a	for example one thing i cant do right now is a simple search popup that would let me keep focus in where i am searching similar to how search in cortana works
3416	0	a	background audio playback working on build does not work on build
3428	0	a	at the moment there is no easy way to prevent a oneway binding from clearing when a dependencyproperty is set to a new value
3431	0	a	our desktop application displays a dialog using the getopenfilename api function access to the network drive may fail
3432	0	a	there is no problem when accessing by computer name
3433	0	a	it does not always result in an error
3437	0	a	i use them in the speech sdk for a desktop application and are now trying to use them in a uwp app
3439	0	a	ive written a helper for binding to and from observables similar to frameworks like angular
3441	0	a	its currently available at
3443	0	a	system is deleting and recreating the tls selfsigned certificates for the device portal on port a lot sometimes every minutes in the windows log
3444	0	a	for sure it resets them every reboot
3446	0	a	when you view an exception you get a completely useless stacktrace with only hex values for function names because of optimization
3447	0	a	we cant use that at all
3449	0	a	this enumeration is mainly used with appbarbutton like as appbarbutton iconsmile
3450	0	a	recent segoe mdl asset have many of new glyphs
3451	0	a	but the enumeration of symbol is not updated from win
3452	0	a	and some of important glyphs of are also lacked from the enumeration
3454	0	a	for example share glyph xed is not enumerated
3457	0	a	but many of developers dont
3458	0	a	like photo app
3467	0	a	this cause the many of engineers use the bitmap or other similar glyphs
3473	0	a	this is still happening ive tested it myself now after the update to
3474	0	a	my users are also reporting the same problem and some of them say they resign of the appplatform
3475	0	a	and i must say that i completely understand them
3476	0	a	how we the developers are supposed to work when such important thing like access to files is not working after the os update
3477	0	a	this affects many of the apps and in result the whole platform
3478	0	a	the futureaccesslist has an issue
3479	0	a	after a firmware update for my phone i was unable to retrieve foldersfiles from a token
3480	0	a	the token i was asking for was present in the futureaccesslist but it gave me a filenotfoundexception
3481	0	a	as the pervious post has been marked as completed i am rising the problem again
3490	0	a	please let me know if you would like to use this as the code itself is ready to go and easy to use
3492	0	a	today only selectrangeitemindexrange itemindexrange exists in listview to add new selection range to the current selection and selectedranges property is only get
3495	0	a	expected behavior
3498	0	a	after releasing the pointer or finger the list abruptly return to position and the refresh indicator is hidden
3499	0	a	i noticed there is a possibility to block payments in the interface of my windows store developer account but it is a boolean
3500	0	a	would it be possible to get paid only a certain amount leaving the remainder blocked on the ms account
3502	0	a	and the interest for ms would be obvious
3503	0	a	we live in a connected world
3504	0	a	and i have a connected app that benefits from fast low latency networks but can work with a larger buffer if need be
3507	0	a	textbox that indicates validation results this filed is required
3514	0	a	for consistency sakes requesting same from all async awaitables
3515	0	a	in an ideal world i should be able to invoke a task and than optionally send it somewhere else for continuation or just forget about it
3518	0	a	right now the apis only allow recognition of text input
3519	0	a	i know microsoft already has the digital ink recognition technology for math formulas
3520	0	a	its even available in wpf via math input control
3524	0	a	it seems that since around when showing loggingchannellogmessage calls the string message portion is blank in device portal shows stringmessage
3525	0	a	same code on machine with anniversary update portal shows the string message in payload
3526	0	a	capturing events with xperf shows the message in eventdata as expected so i know its logging correctly
3529	0	a	this idea has already been posted for winrt years ago
3531	0	a	the main scenario is mvvm and resolving a view from a viewmodel
3532	0	a	this scenario is described in this post
3537	0	a	currently the only way to set backgrounddownloaders header is by setheader method unfortunately once you set the heder value you cannot clear it as the method
3539	0	a	this method can be called multiple times for the same header
3540	0	a	the values will then be concatenated
3541	0	a	the problem comes when we want to create multiple downloads with one downloader if the server requires to send request via headers we are not able to downloaded filesitems within one downloader every item requires to create a new downloader instance with new headers
3542	0	a	of course in that case we cannot use grouped toast notification
3549	0	a	request for an editable combo box that allows
3550	0	a	currently page breaks are not supported with the printhelper
3553	0	a	currently it is possible to specify multiple groupssubgroups within the various tile sizes for adaptive tiles but if the content doesnt fit then some groups wont necessarily ever be shown they are dropped since the tile cant fit the groups
3555	0	a	i recently browsed the uwp docs and found some interesting apis about accessory management etc
3559	0	a	for me it is perfectly acceptable to request access to them so they are still under control but i do not want to create a company account for this
3560	0	a	without apis you are losing customers to androidios as many people would love to have apps which can control their volume system theme etc
3562	0	a	current steps are outlined here
3566	0	a	since i developed an application which could massively profit from those apis as they allow volume control etc i wanted to use them
3567	0	a	unfortunately for me i cannot use those apis as they are restricted for use and getting access is only possible with a company developer account which i do not have
3569	0	a	for me it is perfectly acceptable to request access to them so they are still under control but i do not want to create more
3571	0	a	i have lost count of the number of times ive forgot to set it to oneway
3573	0	a	yes i know why it isnt but looking at my code nearly every instance is set to oneway or twoway anyway
3576	0	a	on both the mobile and desktop versions of the store app you can browse these categories
3577	0	a	however this feature is not present in the store app on the xbox
3578	0	a	unless your app makes it into the top apps sections or promoted apps then users can only download your app if they know about it and search for it by name themselves
3579	0	a	if their app like mine is published solely to the xbox then it makes it very hard for users to become aware of your app
3580	0	a	when you publish an app in dev center it allows you to select the category and subcategory for the app to be placed into
3584	0	a	if their app like mine is published solely to the xbox then it makes it more
3588	0	a	if you have no more disk space the install crashed
3590	0	a	the combination of toasts and action center provide a convenient lightweight way to communication with users but after notifications are read they disappear
3592	0	a	im currently working on a clock control for my uwp todolist app day wwwdayappcom
3593	0	a	im creating this control using inspiration from the great material design wpf toolkit
3594	0	a	the very early work in progress version is available on my repo
3597	0	a	in uwp we have a commandbar but it seems its not easy to use to build a classic toolbar for a desktop application
3601	0	a	but as this is such a central control it should be part of the platform
3603	0	a	ive spent some hours to build a small mvvmuwppivot prototype that does the typical stuff we do today in wpf with tabcontrol
3604	0	a	and i was impressed how far i got
3611	0	a	currently the pivot has no overflowpanel
3612	0	a	its also not wrapping the headers
3614	0	a	i didnt find the option
3616	0	a	i created a separate uservoice entry
3617	0	a	styling of content i was not able to get rid of that entranceanimation slide in from the leftanimationtransition
3618	0	a	allow for no overflow
3619	0	a	allow for no wrapping
3628	0	a	big asks are asks are more
3629	0	a	youre building on a treeviewcontrol as your backlog on shows
3630	0	a	im using the treeview of your official samples on
3631	0	a	the point that i really miss when working with hierarchical data is the hierarchicaldatatemplate like we have it today in wpf
3633	0	a	it makes especially sense when you release a control for hierarchical data like the treeview
3634	0	a	entries as limit for futureaccesslist is way to low
3637	0	a	best practice until now
3638	0	a	store the folder containing the file wont exceed the limit as fast as storing each file in the futureaccesslist
3639	0	a	one exception where a folder cant be added
3640	0	a	a big downside hides in dragdrop
3642	0	a	to counter that and trying to add the folder from the file this wont be possible because an exception would be thrown even if you added the file itself to the futureaccesslist before that
3643	0	a	example trying to add folder from dragdrop filetarget to futureaccesslist
3655	0	a	were not able to add this folder
3673	0	a	i dont for how long but i noticed it a few days back that there is a change in de windows app store seacchresults
3675	0	a	pc apps are harder to find this way
3676	0	a	also i noticed that in the mobile store apps are shown twice after search with a keyword
3678	0	a	is this new policy or is it a bug
3683	0	a	when building lineofbusinessapps for enterprises we often focus on desktop only
3684	0	a	today were using wpf for these tasks
3689	0	a	similar request but a report control for rdlc support
3692	0	a	currently it is nearly impossible to create a custom virtualizing panel
3694	0	a	but in uwp it is impossible because the base classes have private constructors and the other classes are sealed
3695	0	a	a lot of custom controls do not use virtualization because it is so hard to implement in uwp
3696	0	a	this makes the controls hard or even impossible to use with large collections
3699	0	a	adcontrol on xbox in retail mode crashes app works fine in dev mode or on desktop mobile
3700	0	a	something has changed in the microsoft store services sdk framework or in the microsoft advertising sdk for xaml library that is updated automatically to the xbox since february th
3701	0	a	to repro download any app from the store which contains ads and it will instantly crash on the spash screen
3704	0	a	all the other platforms support this net silverlight android xamarin and even ios xamarin
3705	0	a	why is the uwp team stubbornly resisting this
3707	0	a	other platforms allow for customization to be downloaded and dynamically loaded in to the app domain
3708	0	a	with apps increasingly going the encrypted route our app eartrumpet is finding it harder and harder to retrieve the running appx apps current application icon ie
3711	0	a	apis is messy and not appropriate for loading scale sensitive assets
3712	0	a	parsing the pri is only possible in unencrypted appx scenarios
3714	0	a	the current options have the current drawbacks for me
3719	0	a	there are genuine use cases when we need to keep an app running when close button is pressed
3727	0	a	you can only allow an app to catch close button event and minimise it to task bar programatically
3734	0	a	currently i have to save a mp stream to a file and then read from the file and transmit it over tcp
3738	0	a	one scenario is that of a shoutcast source for internet radio streaming
3739	0	a	a shoutcast source transmits mp data via tcp to a shoutcast server
3743	0	a	currently an inprocess appservice can be invoked without actually launching the main app ui
3744	0	a	however once a user launch the main app ui and close it appservice is also terminated because both shared same process
3750	0	a	this control is not to be confused with the existing pivot viewer in uwp
3751	0	a	this control makes a great addition for displaying large amounts of data in a visual friendly format
3753	0	a	the control is the equivalent of a pivot table in excel you simply add the datasets with labels and the control sorts out all the selection fields visualizations and animations
3754	0	a	this was the original microsoft link for the pivot control in silverlight
3756	0	a	related to feature request
3763	0	a	it might be necessary to ensure the downloaded base images are not corrupted and it would be very nice for you to provide them
3765	0	a	i cannot port my windows phone silverlight app to uwp because it is depending on the panorama control which is missing in uwp
3768	0	a	the hub control is not a suitable replacement
3773	0	a	use case as neither groove nor spotify have a lyrics functionality anymore i created a simple uwp app to manage lyrics for songs
3782	0	a	following data would be great
3788	0	a	linked to github
3799	0	a	there is systemtriggertype powerstatechange but it is not triggered when percent is changed
3800	0	a	so one of two options would be useful
3802	0	a	right now to show something on lock screen we have text and icon notifications at the bottom
3817	0	a	there is no way to implement complex text markup rendering without directd or slow manual composition inside canvas control
3818	0	a	there is absolutely no easy way to implement selectable text with complex markup
3819	0	a	richeditbox control exists but there is no lightweight control for just display rich text richtextblock isnt related to richeditbox and featurelame
3820	0	a	the toastnotification object has a convenient expirationtime property that automatically dismisses it after a given period
3821	0	a	unfortunately the scheduledtoastnotification which is just a toastnotofcation but scheduled lacks this helping feature
3822	0	a	this makes me as a developer scracth my head and write a lot of code including background tasks just so i circumvent this problem and not have the users of my app get crowded with notsorelevantanymore notifications in their action center
3824	0	a	the mapcontrol is quite limited in operations with custom tiles
3825	0	a	i have need to redraw the tiles periodically because they become outdated the closest similar example is traffic layer which needs to be periodically refreshed
3827	0	a	even more since this operation results in tiles flickering because of redraw i have to use tile sources switching between them
3828	0	a	that crasy staff involves heavy redrawing of the map and it also leads to visble scrolling slowing down in the moment of maptilesource adding which would be nice to fix too
3833	0	a	the ugly workaround i use is adding and removing maptilesource which forces tiles redraw
3836	0	a	currently uwp apps have no ability to include menu controls with excellent mouse support
3847	0	a	one click to close the first menu and a second click to open the new one
3849	0	a	at the moment there is no possibility to quickly navigate through long lists on small screens
3851	0	a	but sometimes lists are not in alphabetic order or there are still thousands of entries starting with the same letter
3852	0	a	i dont know what the component should look like
3855	0	a	if the list is alphabetic there is at least the possibility to jump to the first entry with the same first letter
3859	0	a	i want to test my apps in multiple languages without changing the region of my entire device
3869	0	a	im developing a windows universal app and i am sicked and tired of finding a way to implement encrypted local db support
3870	0	a	i already have a database file encrypted by sql cipher and i just have to read the records
3872	0	a	but sqlcipher is not it supports only commercial edition and i cant afford the expense
3874	0	a	surprisingly no one of them supports universal app implementation
3875	0	a	thats ridiculous and i am sick and tired of finding the way
3876	0	a	does microsoft really not support local database in developing universal app
3877	0	a	i cant understand why i am confused in this situation which is possible on android or ios so easy
3882	0	a	i know sqlite support universal app development through nuget in vs
3886	0	a	thats ridiculous and i am sick and tired more
3887	0	a	basic scenario is the need to store set of secret api keys for various rd party apis twitter for example
3896	0	a	just to hardcode api keys inside app executable files is security risk as it can be reverse engeneered
3901	0	a	hello there is currently a bug withing the insider preview for desktop and phone
3903	0	a	mouse scrolling works fine and it was also tested on the normal windows builds where it was working as intended
3905	0	a	and i created this thread on the msdn forum where it was confirmed that this is an insider preview bug
3906	0	a	you can also find a code sample here
3912	0	a	i found this thread on github
3919	0	a	could do something like
3925	0	a	td stylemy teste heretd
3932	0	a	this is reproducible in the xamlanimatedgif sample app on win desktop
3938	0	a	notice animated gifs appear
3944	0	a	at least one of the animated gifs will disappear
3945	0	a	eventually they all disappeared for me
3948	0	a	this facility exist for public store apps but not lob ones
3952	0	a	i find myself writing this control over and over in various projects and its never vey good
3958	0	a	allow panning and zooming
3965	0	a	it also creates a large hurdle for new users and causes a number of headaches
3966	0	a	the issue is that our software uses ui access to emulate an onscreen touchpad and custom gestures
3967	0	a	we also allow for simultaneous pen and touch to add touch keyboard hotkeys to a docked custom keyboard typically aids in drawing and ink based applications
3970	0	a	i love what you guys are doing and can not tell you enough how much anticipation i have to get in touch with you guys and find the answers to these questions
3972	0	a	it would mean the world to me
3978	0	a	our question is would converting our app to use newer windows ink code forgive my lack of knowledge here and if more
3980	0	a	here are some more things i would appreciate
3982	0	a	the scaling of the website sometimes doesnt work
3985	0	a	i dont know if it is only me but i cant kill a running process but i can stop a running app
3988	0	a	execution on every restart
3990	0	a	text and parts of graphs are not wisible because it disappears below
3992	0	a	i dont know if it is only me but i cant more
3996	0	a	currently smartcard api doesnt have any method to force a reader to reset smartcard cold reset or warm reset as described in iso
3997	0	a	it is important as fallback mechanism when the smart card is not responding
4001	0	a	this is really way too long in uwp xaml not addressed
4002	0	a	public static readonly dependencyproperty istestproperty dependencypropertyregisternameofistesttypeofbool
4005	0	a	i have two versions of my app one for windows phone vxxx and another one for windows mobile vxxx
4006	0	a	latter uses new features of windows and receives excellent reviews but store mixes them with worse ratings from windows phone users
4008	0	a	my app users are reporting that they cant get information about my durable addon on the xbox one and xbox one s
4009	0	a	when my code checks for the property addonlicenses the collection is empty for users that have purchased the addon
4010	0	a	we have tried with extendedjsondata property but the addon array is empty too
4011	0	a	we cant determine if the addon is active and neither the expiration date
4016	0	a	when user invoke the access key of a button to navigate out the accesskeydisplaydismissed event of the command bar button isnt invoked
4018	0	a	when the user pressed the access key of a button to navigate out the tooltips of command bar buttons stay where they are
4022	0	a	if a url is required then either i have to use something like onedrive which i think looks a bit unprofessional or i have to create a web page which requires hosting etc and either way it creates an extra separate thing for me to have to manage and remember
4026	0	a	i would prefer it if everything to do more
4027	0	a	when using windowsmediatranscodingmediatranscoder to transcode alac file to something else it reports codecnotfound
4028	0	a	however alac decoding is supported according to this page
4029	0	a	more interestingly transcoding other files to alac works fine
4033	0	a	privateobject and privatetype are missing in microsoftvisualstudiotestplatformunittestframework
4034	0	a	on this page there is explanation how to make a file explorer integration on a desktop bridge app
4037	0	a	im working on porting an app that could calculate md checksums on a file
4038	0	a	i want to add this as a context menu option on for instance zip and isofiles
4041	0	a	also there is no way to having different verbs on different file types which could be quite limiting
4048	0	a	but its not possible to do this without making a file type association as i get it more
4049	0	a	we have a uwp in the store and a desktop companion app
4050	0	a	currently to install our software and have it function both programs are needed
4053	0	a	the issue we run into is that our desktop app uses ui access
4054	0	a	is ui access support on the list of upcoming features
4055	0	a	having a good informed answer to this question will help tremendously in helping us understand how to proceed
4056	0	a	i would be beyond excited to get a response
4057	0	a	it would mean the world to our small team to hear from you all
4058	0	a	some of our ui access features may be convertible to direct ink functionality would that be a worthwhile pursuit or would that leave us facing the same intersection from a different direction
4060	0	a	our app is called tablet pro it may be of use to know that
4068	0	a	building our email list has been at the forefront of our small software companies goals for a few years
4069	0	a	probably the biggest question i have is how to use the store without loosing our ability to acquire user emails without complicating the process for the end user
4071	0	a	i may simply be unaware of how this is done
4073	0	a	this would be huge
4076	0	a	we like a number of the benefits the store offers but it seems without a way to build an list of our clients independent of microsoft or anyone but us for that matter is key
4078	0	a	is there a process in place for gaining downloaders email addresses
4080	0	a	since the advent of silverlight pivotviewer control shifted the handling of large datasets giving a way of filtering and analyzing large volumes of data
4082	0	a	for line of business applications processing large datasets
4084	0	a	currently the scrollviewers content can be overpanned
4087	0	a	support the last version of net standard
4088	0	a	developing desktop apps for uwp is subpar as many api are not present like sqlclient
4091	0	a	the store does not allow a developer to update their response to a users review once it is made public while users are allowed to update their reviews at will
4092	0	a	a user may change his review completely and the original response could become totally irrelevant
4095	0	a	i am attempting to design something to support functionality similar to androids startactivityforresult using the page stacks but i have no visibility into the management of the page stacks backstack and forwardstack
4096	0	a	this introduces the opportunity for a memory leak as these stacks are pruned in response to user navigations
4099	0	a	winrt information the maximum number of items in the access list has been reached
4106	0	a	this supports the use case for providing a detail view for both the underlying item represented by the group header template as well as that of the represented by the itemtemplate
4108	0	a	currently i am prohibited from extending and overridding various methods in my case those concerning navigation
4112	0	a	as a long time wp and now wm user i noticed inconsistent behavior of opening flyout with touch versus mouse
4115	0	a	instead in wm it opens just when i release the finger
4116	0	a	this is very annoying as i never know if there is some additional menu under the item or not
4119	0	a	context menu appears while my finger is still touching the screen
4123	0	a	but when using touch gesture i would expect behavior known from wp flyout aka context menu should open after couple miliseconds while my finger is still touching the given item
4128	0	a	i use imfsourcereader on uwp and noticed following bug with flac decoding it will not change position if setcurrentposition will be called right after initialization
4129	0	a	it is working correct with mp and other codecs but not with flac
4131	0	a	this would allow apps to say they were listening to kexp instead only and the station information as well
4136	0	a	with silverlight in windows phone i had the ability to use fm radio apis
4137	0	a	in uwp i cannot use these apis as they werent brought over
4141	0	a	from an accessory device like a smartwatch possible
4142	0	a	our desktop application provides users with custom contact data that wed like to sync for them with windows contacts
4143	0	a	we are working on the converted version of the app to enable such capabilities and to distribute our desktop app via the windows store but we have to distribute it for previous versions of windows as well and so we cant afford having two completely different versions of the product for the time being
4145	0	a	why do you always have to make a developers life difficult
4146	0	a	theres no easy way to detect left control key pushes
4147	0	a	because on international keyboards if right alt is pressed then left control is also pressed
4148	0	a	why oh why this is the stupidest thing ever
4152	0	a	but that doesnt work too because now it turns out that if i press just rightalt then i can get callbacks for leftctrl and rightalt happening in different frames
4153	0	a	onkeydown with leftctrl gets called in frame
4154	0	a	onkeydown with rightalt gets called in frame
4156	0	a	waiting for reply
4162	0	a	so ive developed a work around to detect key pushes for leftctrl and rightalt and if both are pressed at the same time then leftctrl pushes are ignored
4166	0	a	i want my user to stay inside my app
4172	0	a	im using the result of midioutportgetdeviceselector for the device selector string
4173	0	a	the deviceinformation for some of the virtual software ports on the system are returning with generic device names
4174	0	a	a user of ymidi contacted me about this problem
4175	0	a	hes using loopmidi a virtual midi loopback from tobias erichsen
4179	0	a	have you seen this behavior before
4180	0	a	im using the property deviceinformationname in my application to display the port name
4182	0	a	using deviceinformationfindallasync in my ccx application to enumerate existing midi ports on the system
4190	0	a	we just switched to win sdk and are now getting some new warnings in cpp files with include windowsh
4191	0	a	warning is an extra one we have enabled beyond warning level
4194	0	a	cprogram files xwindows kitsincludeumwinioctlh warning c winwinntwinth is not defined as a preprocessor macro replacing with for ifelif compiling source file srcwinappinsightswincpp
4200	0	a	similar issue
4201	0	a	currently any uwp developer is forced to use c for accessing directx features or rely on third party support like sharpdx or unityd for those features
4204	0	a	currently a control will not be able to handle the request if the event has already been subscribed to in order to handle navigation
4207	0	a	this gave the masterdetailsview the time it needed to subscribe to the event first in order to handle it
4208	0	a	in other projectsframeworks like template this is not as easily handled because those frameworks have a navigation service that subscribes to the backrequested event first
4212	0	a	the only work around i found for the sample app was to unsubscribe from the event in the shell when the frame has navigated and then subscribe to the event again in the more
4214	0	a	but i mostly care about windows phone
4215	0	a	i can see the tasks but i cant terminate them
4218	0	a	i know you have tweaked alarm volume in insider builds but you simply cannot cover all user need if you dont provide them the slider
4219	0	a	many users still complains about given volume even fade in doesnt save the situation
4225	0	a	i assume its the image for either the left or right eye
4226	0	a	when hololens is in stereo mode show both frames on the emulator
4229	0	a	apparently the uielementkeyup and uielementkeydown events provide the wrong virtualkey information in the keyroutedeventargs
4230	0	a	the problem is when using a physical keyboard and also when using the onscreenkeyboard
4234	0	a	ibm layout the virtualkey information is correct
4239	0	a	its also a total annoyance when working with data that require handling of lots more
4242	0	a	were limited at work since we cant use our mobile devices the way we want
4243	0	a	right now winappdriver only works on desktop
4247	0	a	before our users find them
4258	0	a	right now its not possible to add screenshots for addons in windows store
4259	0	a	this is especially limiting when browsing dlcs for games without any screenshots
4262	0	a	for example the minimum requirements operating system windows or later required
4266	0	a	however i am developing a chinese zhtw app using mapcontrol on my computer
4267	0	a	unfortunately we cant set the mapcontrol language by programming to a specific value
4268	0	a	mapcontrol always uses the windows display language
4269	0	a	it is inconvenient for me to debug a chinese app with mapcontrol while my favorite windows display languages is enus
4279	0	a	i hardly understand why store app dev center requires azure ad account for adding managers
4280	0	a	this work is not viable to indi devs
4283	0	a	my app contains inapp purchases but customers can not buy these inapp purchases in the windows store for business
4286	0	a	but that has a very big impact on maintenance because we would have to support apps
4289	0	a	obviously the free sdk is a good start
4291	0	a	the current windows audio driver design only allows you to use channels simulatenously
4292	0	a	there are many devices like a usbmadi or dante virtual soundcard which use at least channels
4294	0	a	this is a real problem
4297	0	a	i really hope this will change in the near future because for pro audio applications something really has to change
4308	0	a	currently document function is disabled
4310	0	a	downloadoperation backgroundtransfer api restarts from when resumed after being paused at progressbytesreceived progresstotalbytestoreceive and startasync task hasnt completed
4315	0	a	the language swift was created by apple for use on ios and macos

4319	0	a	desktop app converter constantly fails with the ecreatingisolatedenvfailed error
4320	0	a	the inner exception that has sense is the systemiodirectorynotfoundexception
4322	0	a	systemiodirectorynotfoundexception the system cannot find the path specified
4323	0	a	exception from hresult x
4324	0	a	most probably the problem is in these two lines
4325	0	a	setting up conversion environment
4326	0	a	i looked through the guidnamed folder and found no shared folder inside
4327	0	a	so no contents of myapp and no knownfolderdumpexe
4328	0	a	the dac folder exists but under output not under shared
4330	0	a	the question is how to fix that
4331	0	a	the problem occurs on every conversion
4332	0	a	ps i cannot try to create the folders in advance because each time the converter generates and uses a new guid
4333	0	a	i tried three different installers innosetup a plain selfextracting archive produced by zip and vlc media player from the video tutorial by avneet singh and david tepper
4334	0	a	im on windows pro x version build
4336	0	a	thank you for any advice
4347	0	a	and the dac folder more
4348	0	a	dear dev team
4356	0	a	wifi and bluetooth work well but the mobilebroadband is in this value is defined for future use and is not currently available
4358	0	a	thank you
4359	0	a	hello all
4363	0	a	this would mimic the android capability that already exists for its navigation drawer
4364	0	a	i have actually implemented this in one of my apps so you can see it in action
4365	0	a	it is in an app called drudge live and in the app the swipeopen capability is only enabled on phones
4367	0	a	based on feedback i have received the capability is very important because it allows the use and opening of hamburger menus on phones using one hand
4368	0	a	i was previously getting a lot of grief over the switch to a hamburger menu by phone users but this gives them back the ability to navigate with one hand on the phone
4376	0	a	however there seems to be no such accommodation for style definitions located either in resourcedictionary files or embedded directly into the page xaml
4379	0	a	in code there is a way to detect and work with features that are in newer windows builds using apiinformation so that code can use new features while gracefully degrading on older builds
4381	0	a	if you have a style that uses a new property or enumeration value anyone opening the app in an older win build will immediately crash
4383	0	a	its a lot easier to build a following when its free
4384	0	a	keeping this in mind was thinking of making some of my products donationware
4386	0	a	the ability for an end user to donate allows me to make the app free
4390	0	a	support for developers willing to get the apps converted and placed in the windows store is below anecdotal
4392	0	a	like thousands of other developers i have tried for now over a month to convert my app and followed every literatureput up by microsoft but am still stuck with dependencies
4393	0	a	tried to post in uwp apps but questions remain unanswered
4401	0	a	for such a strategic move where the windows store could remain indigent as during the painful windows x era if nothing is done please make sure developers do not remain in the more
4403	0	a	i was working with webview to display static html and i found an issue
4405	0	a	the litable tags are displayed very small in size
4410	0	a	you can check using below example
4411	0	a	the wns currently does not seem to support lockey locargs apns equivalents
4413	0	a	as a result all of the notification strings have to be generated serverside iterating for all the languages supported by the client like
4414	0	a	this causes us to treat the windows platform as a special case while apns gcm provide a single cohesive story
4415	0	a	this gets even more painful when we work with clientapplication teams that want to customize the localized strings for their platform for a lockey locargs contract
4420	0	a	this gets even more painful when we work with clientapplication teams more
4423	0	a	currently the xaml engine of uwp does not manage complex control attributes since it does not take systemcomponentmodeltypeconverter into account
4424	0	a	that is why we can not write this simple xaml user code
4425	0	a	where the complex property is begin and the complex value is that represents a position x y
4427	0	a	by the way that will be a lot simpler than the wpfs typeconverter
4437	0	a	after having tried typeconverter on uwp i tried to add implicit operators casts to the complex type position here from and to string but xaml does not take them into account
4439	0	a	all my tests and researches made be waste two days for nothing
4444	0	a	tested with vs under windows
4458	0	a	once you create a coreindependentinputsource touch visual feedback is visible again
4459	0	a	even if you disabled it using
4463	0	a	its not about aesthetics visualfeedback kills performance the framerate in games drops by half which is ironic if you think thats the kind of apps coreindependentinputsource was created for in the first place
4466	0	a	coreindependentinputsource has its own dispatcher does that mean it has its own hwndmessage queue
4467	0	a	maybe thats the cause of the bug pointervisualizationsettingsgetforcurrentview is tied to the main window
4469	0	a	i got the hwnd from coreindependentinputsourcedispacher using the vs debug inspector and then called trydisablewindowsvisualfeedback as seen here
4470	0	a	the visual feedback was disabled
4471	0	a	however live code has no access to that hwnd
4472	0	a	all helpful win apis fail one way or another getactivewindow getproccessid enumwindows etc
4482	0	a	wack will be an error by some applications
4483	0	a	wack show an error occurred while generating the report
4485	0	a	of couse another app have success of wack
4486	0	a	i have a question related wack
4487	0	a	when this issue specified test features
4489	0	a	then cant show apps list so i selected an appx package
4490	0	a	to choose what test features is it right
4492	0	a	i have a question related more
4493	0	a	i need to select multiple files to be downloadeduploaded one time
4495	0	a	i also want to create folders to store things in
4496	0	a	seriously while we see a lot of improvement of aspnetrazor languages and even the c language reducing a lot of verbosity in each version with a lot of awesome new features xaml got what in the last years
4498	0	a	seriously to be honest we lose a lot of features with transition of wpf uwp dockpanels adorners etc
4503	0	a	in windows store the longer apps titles or capitalized apps titles for example cobata xhtml constructor are cut to characters doing the apps title meaningless for example cobata xhtml
4504	0	a	it is because the responsible html element cheading class fontsize style property is fixed to px
4516	0	a	how this could work more
4517	0	a	when there is a bulk update requirement as with the age ratings and soon to be with the ad support changes the store is poorly equipped to server those of us that are managing large portfolios and millions of users
4519	0	a	right now i have to manage this myself
4520	0	a	the current status only seems to show in progress if the app has never been put in the store before
4521	0	a	i have lots of apps that are just now showing that they have passed certification days after simply doing the age rating update
4527	0	a	i have lots of apps that are just now showing that they more
4528	0	a	right now richeditbox only supports input and output in rtf format
4530	0	a	httpsys serves as the kernel component backing iis and the net httplistener
4532	0	a	there are a number of failure cases such as a high incoming request rate filling the request queue that can result in the module rejecting incoming requests directly without handing them off to callers higher on the stack
4534	0	a	information about these failed requests is currently only visible via the httperr log file and a few perf counters
4535	0	a	neither is ideal
4536	0	a	the log file is systemwide requires admin access and lacks any information about what request queue the error is associated with
4541	0	a	as such it plays a critical role as the first system to process each incoming http request but it is unfortunately lacking in diagnostics
4543	0	a	this leaves the application unaware that it it experiencing such problems
4544	0	a	information about these failed requests is currently only visible via the httperr log file and more
4546	0	a	and the relativetime it seems not correct sometimes the duration is larger than relativetime
4547	0	a	sometimes the previous frames relativetime is but the next frames relativetime is
4548	0	a	im confused what the is that
4550	0	a	also the audiograph cant to be ensure generate ms of audioframe data even though i have set the quantumsizeselectionmode property to closesttodesired
4551	0	a	this is bad for signal analysis scenario
4554	0	a	when submitting fixing the age ratings age ratings the dev center will not let me submit more than or in a row
4556	0	a	when initiating a chat session the page asks you to let the operator know what the issue is and provides a virtually limitless text field
4557	0	a	there is no indication that the text field will only transmit the first characters to the support technician but that apparently is the limit
4559	0	a	this ends up further frustrating an already distressed developer and making the job that much harder for the support operator needlessly
4563	0	a	this leads the user to have to type again the whole description
4566	0	a	the name reservation field doesnt accept spaces
4574	0	a	loopmidi is also an example of this in the midi realm allowing onthefly creationdestructionrenaming of virtual midi ports although lacking the routingfiltering layer which midioxs primitive gui routingfiltering is a good example of
4576	0	a	some of the above is already possible today theres some virtualaudiocable solutions but its cumbersome nonstandard and definetely not done optimized
4579	0	a	all the above is also somewhat possible today but theres no os based unified paradigm easily controllable by the user
4584	0	a	there has been a huge spike in spammers scraping the windows store website for apps support email
4585	0	a	the automated script leaves a star review and asks that you do the same for their app
4588	0	a	i recenlty rated your app with stars and caption and text great tool i will admit that installing this app was an ordeal
4589	0	a	i want to thank lancelot for taking the time to communicate quickly with me
2914	1	a	have an exporter for a adobe xd file that could translate to xaml
2921	1	a	and it would be great to have a signed version dxgiformatrgbasnorm
2939	1	a	add support to allow wcf services to be consumed that have custom usernamepassword authentication on the binding
2987	1	a	i believe that everyone in xaml lovers we want a robust and complete standard and that facilitates the life of the developer so i propose to include these controls as a standard of xaml specification
3007	1	a	or allow minute or maybe even minute timetriggers to be used
3009	1	a	i would like from the device portal the ability to reset the device
3010	1	a	create a control for continue in different device like continue reading etc
3012	1	a	so it would be nice to create controls to achieve microsofts vision easily
3026	1	a	i would like my apps be automatically supported on any new processor architectures
3031	1	a	please add simple api
3056	1	a	the application xbox dev mode companion should have an option to make it a vr
3058	1	a	make it something unique windows phone attracting more customers
3097	1	a	have a separate class library that only supports new sdk versions and it will only be loaded into the app on newer sdk versions therefore you can write safe xaml markup including new controls and properties
3101	1	a	alternatively it would be nice if the uwp platform was updated separately from windows so apps would be able to support all the new controlsstyles
3104	1	a	there needs to be a way to define new xaml controlspropertiesetc as currently if you want to add these with a lower minimum version it has to be from codebehind
3109	1	a	i would like to try this out making my app an experience shared across multiple close proximity devices but it would be very helpful to see some code samples
3128	1	a	there should be alternative condensed and aligned with win style of controls that we can use to create applications that are looking just like their classical counterparts while benefitting from uwp improvements
3140	1	a	i belive that store should control the sdk level more grained
3143	1	a	please add background to textblock control
3150	1	a	please integrate ffmpeg or vlc libraries by default in these xaml elements to make it easier for developers to build apps that run all kinds of video and audio files
3152	1	a	it would be nice to be able to assign a compiled binding to properties through the visualstate setters of xamlbehaviors
3174	1	a	please add a delegate version for the propertymetadatacreate where the dependencyproperty is supplied so you can create a default value for the dependency object instead of a simple default value
3193	1	a	please bring all languages to cortana for iot because are needed to create devices for interacting people from around the world
3196	1	a	provide semantic animations like fadein fadeout crossfade etc
3199	1	a	should also do this for other converters for same behavior
3238	1	a	if white background scrollbar should be a different color so it is fully visible
3273	1	a	it could be really good to hot reload the app when changing c or xaml code
3276	1	a	it would be great to add a property to choose the direction of the progress bar clockwise or counterclockwise
3277	1	a	when notifications are removed from one device they should be removed from all devices by default
3285	1	a	i know there are no plans for running uwp apps in windows but a designer would be nice and would virtually remove the need to upgrade to windows before writing apps for it
3288	1	a	aside from my personal dilemma of a missing device it would definitely make sense to be able testing code in an emulator first instead of having lots of hardware around all the time
3295	1	a	if microsoft fears somebody could use the emulator for playing games on a computer then just turn off games
3313	1	a	please create actualstartlocation in fileopenpicker so that we can open the file selection dialog into the exact folder we want
3320	1	a	please add an api that allows to read the temperature from the device eg
3349	1	a	please add the ability to access the rendering pipeline to the mapcontrol class
3359	1	a	it would be great if the application executablelauncherexe element or the uapextension categorywindowsappexecutionalias element would allow me to specify arguments in the appxmanifestxml file
3362	1	a	so why not include enablepulltorefresh as a property of masterdetailsview
3365	1	a	it would make developers life much easier if they had a possibility to access files simpler
3387	1	a	so my opinion is to create two new controls
3388	1	a	one is textcanvas for display and editing both text and inking
3407	1	a	it would be great if the roaming folder quota was larger than kb mb at least this would prevent us from having to depend on a networkpaid service to have great crossdevice customer experiences
3408	1	a	this is not really completely uwp related but microsoft should provide free virtual machines of all windows versions for testing purposes as in my experience uwp is really fragile and could make my app behave differently in every version
3413	1	a	do you think that you could make the windows store and other builtinapps accessible from the device portal making it a lot easier to install new apps that are already on the store and make changes in settings etc
3429	1	a	it would be great if something similar to dependencyobjectsetcurrentvalue method from wpf would be introduced in the future so that a dependencyproperty can be set to a new value without missing an oneway binding
3436	1	a	can you please expose the viseme events for the windows speech sythesis
3440	1	a	i think it would be useful to have in the toolkit
3442	1	a	it would be great to be able to bind invoke scripts inside a webview from a viewmodel like binding a url to a property
3448	1	a	symbol enum should be updated with latest segoe mdl asset collections
3459	1	a	if the enumeration are updated with the latest mdl glyphs it may helps many of developers who search the correct glyphs
3493	1	a	could you please add selectrangesienumerabelitemindexrange itemindexranges to be able to add multiple ranges at once and also make selectedranges property is only get set to be able to replace existing selection ranges
3496	1	a	after releasing to refresh the list should animate back to top as a simple list do and while awaitng for the data to be fetched the refresh indicator content should be visible or have a property to control its visibility i would prefer this one
3506	1	a	it would be even better if i could have an api that could make the calculations for me and offer up a packet failureretransmission percent or average time between send and acknowledgment
3512	1	a	optionally the worker side of async awaitable should accept notification uri in conjunction with type which the type itself may or may not exist on the target of execution in which case it can decide to create exception instance or return typical http message the important part is the contract of return notification should be extended to the application developer in a way that allows to harvest its result in an expected format potentially by polling yet another resource
3522	1	a	but either way please do make an api available
3561	1	a	providing thos apps would boost uwp as platform and thus create more possibilities for users and developers together
3568	1	a	please allow private developers to access those capabilities
3585	1	a	i hope everyone can publish fonts on the store
3586	1	a	it would be good for developers to specify auto renewal of the durable paid addons in developer portal so users do not need to repurchase the addon again and again
3598	1	a	a toolbar stacks items from lefttoright and it would be great to have such a toolbar in uwp like we have it today in wpf and several other desktop programming models
3602	1	a	if you build it it would be great if you could add configurable closefunctionality to the tabheader that is bindable to a viewmodel
3609	1	a	i think this could be made simpler by support for example a headerstyleproperty on the pivot
3613	1	a	maybe the dev should be able to define the panel used for the headers
3620	1	a	for a classic desktop application we need a tabcontrol
3632	1	a	so i suggest that you bring the hierarchicaldatatemplate to uwp
3635	1	a	please increase the limit way up or remove it completley
3641	1	a	if you add files from across the filesytem which i do in my app letting the user drop in images and videos from any location you could rapidly hit the files limit
3661	1	a	increase futureaccesslist limit like in millions
3662	1	a	introduce userchoice dialog if accessexception is raised
3663	1	a	also as a secondary request let folderpickersuggestedstartlocation also be a folderrelativeid
3666	1	a	optional show an user input dialog requesting access to the file or folder and let the user decide
3713	1	a	please add a trigger to start a background task when a nearby nfc tag is recognized
3717	1	a	it would be more convenient for the user if my app could react on the nfc tag even when the phone is locked
3724	1	a	add system tray support so that app can be minimised to system tray
3728	1	a	you need to provide corewindowminimise api in this case
3729	1	a	allow other formats than pcm and float for a frameoutputnode created with createframeoutputnode of class audiograph
3735	1	a	this burden would be eliminated would mp frames be available by the frameoutputnode
3737	1	a	other formats like mp or ogg would be nice
3745	1	a	it must be possible to only unload main ui out of the process without terminating the app service
3746	1	a	allow changing of volume in the windows device portal
3749	1	a	please add the old silverlight pivot control to uwp toolkit
3769	1	a	can you please add an iap which would have a recurring payment automatically charge user monthly annually etc
3780	1	a	i would like to add a function that automatically loads the lyrics to the song that is played right now
3781	1	a	to solve that it would be enough to have read access to the system media transport controls data of other apps
3787	1	a	it could be interesting to provide a control to generate and show a power bi chart inside a uwp application easily with a control or by code
3801	1	a	it would be useful for creating more userfriendly battery related apps that provide better experience for example by refreshing tile or sending notification on the event not some time after it happened
3803	1	a	we can also change lock screen background
3804	1	a	however it would be useful to get more flexibility
3807	1	a	if we could put some templated or custom notifications it would save us a lot of work and make lock screen more user friendly
3814	1	a	provide more rich api for text rendering without need to use lowlevel directd for rich text rendering capabilities
3829	1	a	id also be happy if maptilesource property changes like bounds were applied to the map without need to remove the tile source and add it back this is how it can be done currently
3842	1	a	compare the ui usage with google chrome for example
3858	1	a	maybe by default the way it looks now but it should have a slider that is magnified if the user taps close to edge of the list and signals its intention to use more
3889	1	a	there is should be a way to include secure data as strings or byte remotely at dev center as app setting
3894	1	a	there is should be way to revoke secure data on server which would require republishing app with new set of keys and app with revoked keys should fail on access to secure storage
3898	1	a	this data should be accessible from secure key storage immediately after app install and keys should be installed into secure key storage as part of app installation process
3947	1	a	provide ability to deploy an update to certain users only
3950	1	a	it would really be great if there was a control which allows to move forward an backward like the microsoft edge browser does with touch input or touchpad input
3951	1	a	it should work like a horizontal listview or gridviewso you can normally scroll through the listed items but when you hit the end of the list and continue scrolling the edgelike part should kick in and navigate you to new or old viewpagelist
3953	1	a	id love a control that would be a sibling to listview or gridview only it was backed by a d canvas instead of an itemsstackpanel
3955	1	a	allow the placement of rectangular items in d
3957	1	a	an optional bonus would be to allow the user to rotate the items
3959	1	a	the look and content of the items should of course be customizable
3960	1	a	it would be extremely helpful to be able to create mediasourcestreams for audio streams in the vorbis andor opus formats
3995	1	a	dockpanel should be ported to windows xaml
3998	1	a	currently store access from windows is either enabled or disabled this really needs to be more granular ie
4000	1	a	should be clear nullable properties in xaml should be supported and not give the error cannot assign to nullable type on property
4012	1	a	please check and fix this bug as it is causing frustration to xbox users
4021	1	a	for me personally it would be much more convenient to be able to enter my privacy policy content directly into a text field when submittingupdating my app rather than having to provide a url so i think this should be an option
4032	1	a	allow us to use runtime arguments for windowsapplicationmodelfulltrustprocesslauncherlaunchfulltrustprocessforcurrentappasync in addition to the parameters declared in the manifest
4036	1	a	in short you could add something like this in your manifestfile
4040	1	a	in my case i would also be happy if it was possible to add verbs on all file types but this is something i could live without
4051	1	a	merging them into a single installer would benefit our users greatly
4052	1	a	it seems in order to do that we need to either pull out of the store or convert our desktop app to a uwp and merge the two installers
4086	1	a	it would be great if we have an option in disabling the overpanning behavior in scrollviewer with an api or with any other option to disable it
4090	1	a	net standard should be used by uwp and not limited by it
4094	1	a	because only simple values are supposed to be used as navigation parameters this suggests that a thirdparty software component must exist for managing the sharing of complex objects between pages
4103	1	a	evidently this is a limitation of the mediacompositionsaveasync api it should be fixed
4130	1	a	if fm radio apis are brought in it would be amazing if we could get rds support as well
4135	1	a	i believe this should be a user based permission api in case the user doesnt want me to have this ability
4138	1	a	i would greatly apperciate if these apis could be added to uwp
4144	1	a	itd be fantastic if it could be possible to access such data from the converted classic apps
4165	1	a	if my app is currently playing audio it would be nice if my app could control the experience and interact how i would want it to outside of the system experience
4167	1	a	i would like to control have my app control the vibrationhaptic feedback setting
4170	1	a	just imagine connecting your phone to a display device and building uwp apps on it it can be the next big thing for developers because no developer wants to carry a kg laptop wherever he goes
4198	1	a	it would be cool to have a option to remove the border and caption of the window so we can make non rectangular windows just like with gdi and the layered windows api
4202	1	a	please expose the directx com api as uwp one having the api coming from microsoft would be a much better guarantee than relying on third partys or inhouse wrappers
4209	1	a	subscribers of the backrequested event should be notified in stack order instead of queue order
4211	1	a	example in the uwp community toolkit the masterdetailsview control needs to listen to the back requested event to handle navigating back when in a collapsed state with selection
4217	1	a	it would be great if user and dev could modify alarm volume
4220	1	a	the best it would be if also dev could set volume granularly on each toast notification
4221	1	a	user might want lower volume for morning alarms and louder volume for alarm used during busy day
4227	1	a	let the user choose between spitscreen or anaglyph redcyan
4231	1	a	the only workaround so far is to write the text in a winwpf application and then copypaste the text into the appropriate fields which causes a serious security problem when working with critical passwords
4241	1	a	please add full ldapsupport query read write
4245	1	a	making it possible for us to write tests and code once and have it being tested in an autonomous way
4251	1	a	provide libraries to help me get started with project rome and building a crossdevice experience for my application
4252	1	a	enable linux devices to be included in a users device graph to enable discovery launching of apps and communication between connected devices
4253	1	a	enable ios devices to be included in a users device graph to enable discovery launching of apps and communication between connected devices
4254	1	a	i would like to be able to have screenshots for each and every action for a winappdriver like i had with codedui via uitestactionloghtml see for what i am looking for
4255	1	a	it would be very useful if you allow external devices eg through bluetooth to control the running audiovideo on the phone
4264	1	a	please allow to set the display language of mapcontrol to one different from windows display language
4270	1	a	music app can provide to its users an extended network functionality such as audio streaming upnpdlna or smbcifs or ftp client to get music files from server upnpdlna client to send audio data to renderer upnpdlna media server or renderer
4274	1	a	it would be useful to have either backgroundnetwork new capability or atleast extend backgroundmediaplayback capability and if playback is active which can possibly be using network communication and app is not suspended keep network communication active
4285	1	a	the only option for now would be to make a separate pro app
4288	1	a	please add an azure developer vm for windows with unity
4295	1	a	the playback devices and recording devices section should be merged and more info like samplerate channelcount and meters for every input and output should be added with a better ui
4296	1	a	it should also be possible to easily select the device where you want to play your system sounds but also to select two channels of a multichannel device if you need your average stereo output for most applications
4309	1	a	therefore it would be nice to have an option like xsltsettingsenabledocumentfunction property in net apps
4312	1	a	please add ability to remove azure ad association
4313	1	a	please add to manage users accountlevel permission show notifications for disableenable this option
4318	1	a	adding this may encourage more developers to port their apps to windows from ios and make things more familiar
4349	1	a	please provide an api for quiet hours in windows mobile where developers can set the quiet hours parameters from foreground and background
4362	1	a	i would propose adding the ability for the splitview pane to be opened by swiping in from the left side of the screen
4385	1	a	would it be feasible to somehow make this type of offering as part of the store
4422	1	a	the xaml engine of uwp should manage complex types for xaml attributes
4452	1	a	i suggest to make the xaml engine able to use an interface that lets transcode convert an instance to and from a string
4454	1	a	allow the ability to open the explorer and show a selected file in the explorer so that the view is already scrolled to have to file visible
4500	1	a	advanced creation tools need to implement features like the eye dropper which allow the user to select a color on the screen and use it in the application
4508	1	a	it would be great if you could request special permission from the user like a notification manager request and that would allow the password manager to fill password forms
4515	1	a	there would need to be some things that would probably need to be specified for that to work such as specifying a username textbox
4529	1	a	please add few enhancements so it accepts html also or add a converter which may help developers
4538	1	a	i suggest making this data more accessible so that servers can be better monitored both to track failures and to inform a cloud system it needs to scale out to more servers
4539	1	a	new http server and httplistener apis should be added that surface the failures and request queue state
4552	1	a	it would be great to add new status like closed or abandoned
4560	1	a	please set a limit and if you are going to ask for a description make it at least or characters long
4569	1	a	windows should allow users to freely redirect media audio midi even video someday i guess fromto the hardwareaudio interface webcam etc andor applications even considering the desktop as a videoaudio media generator
4573	1	a	it could be as simplistic as allowing piping appsdevices outputs into appsdevices inputs through virtual interfaces managed by the user through a piping routing manager gui
4603	1	a	there should be a native way for developers to omit their app from being able to show a preview when hovered over in the taskbar as well as preventing the screenshot that is visible in the recent apps section on mobile
4612	1	a	we are aware of the risk of allowing an app to hide itself from the system but it would be beneficial for security software to have a means of controlling any data that may need to be hidden
4630	1	a	at this point i think it might be best to just lift the restriction of insider reviews and also show more reviews regardless of version
4632	1	a	at the very least dont delete reviews from the dev center even if theyre not displayed in the store so we can use them for marketing etc
4639	1	a	why dont we support adjacenttotopdisplayedge and adjacenttobottomdisplayedge too
4654	1	a	make it possible to add the environmentpermission node in the packageappxmanifest to allow environment variables to be retrieved
4669	1	a	add this for sideloaded or enterprise distributed apps on desktop devices
4672	1	a	set up a uwp shell app to test within
4673	1	a	do the minimum to create an instance of a tcp service and add a text attribute with a keyvalue pair
4718	1	a	in addition to existing functionality which allows to collect dump when app crashes it would be nice to have an option to collect dump of running process on windows mobile any time you want via device portal
4723	1	a	add a usernotificationchangedtriggerdetails to usernotificationchangedtrigger background task with at least
4745	1	a	my suggestion is to change the behavior of that triggers or add another pair which will fire on lockunlock transitions
4768	1	a	this behavior should be fixed or a new property should be made available in the sdk to enable us to get the user defined settings for regional format
4770	1	a	we need a way to have a system wide overlay notification
4774	1	a	this could be used in the new skype preview app and would be extremly awesome and powerful
4787	1	a	please update torch driver for these devices we need use torch for our apps
4790	1	a	allowing subpixel font rendering would make them look on par with desktop apps
4798	1	a	please increase these limits maybe as an opt in
4804	1	a	keep in mind the limits command elements in a command set listenfor entries in a command total phraselist elements and total phraselist items across all phraselists
4824	1	a	to do so it is crucial we can remove the close button or complete titlebar from the tabtip keyboard
4842	1	a	use file playback sample or custom effects sample
4878	1	a	and for the consistency of the ui design sometimes it will be nice to allow the app freely styling the buttonsespecially the close button
4880	1	a	for example developers can hide those builtin buttons and draw their own ones and call corewindowminimize corewindowmaximize etc
4885	1	a	looking forward to customizable window chrome for uwp apps
4895	1	a	an example is in vs i have files copied in during a build process and would like the ability to write against the
4901	1	a	so please make all versions the default
4915	1	a	can you add a new property in ocr library so that the developers can tell the engine which direction the text was written in
4947	1	a	add support for ngening to the desktop bridge installation
4960	1	a	it would be great if mediacontrol supported webm format
4961	1	a	this property needs to be implemented for mobile as well to enable a true universal app scenario
4962	1	a	i would like the ability in xaml to conditionally have my xaml output be compile with flags like you can currently with c
4973	1	a	it would be more useful to be able to sort by reviews acquisitions crashes and ratings
4991	1	a	while this could be also a fix for roslyn systemruntimecsharpanalyzers the generated bindings are not the owner of the disposable fields and should just ignore the warnings
5003	1	a	please add shell context menus api for uwp apps
5017	1	a	a simple property to set and get focused item would be appreciated
5029	1	a	so please add tcp timestamps option support to the streamsocketcontrol class
5032	1	a	please add a way to get a storyboard is paused
5037	1	a	what would be nice is instead of sending tile notifications for every minute if there was a way to better adjust the live tile image every minute
5060	1	a	id also love to see better extensionentrypointos integration similar to appv
5083	1	a	please provide a template for dx xaml interop
5098	1	a	once a storagefile or storagefolder is allowed to be accessed by the user it should be accessible across all those different api
5100	1	a	it would be nice to have a commandline tool to submit apps to the store
5106	1	a	launcherlaunchfolderasync should accept a storagefile as first argument
5119	1	a	it would be great to have the ability to hide all appscategories in with windows store and only have it show the private app store
5130	1	a	it would be very useful to add this feature into hosted web apps so that native textboxes in a web application can inherit this capability when converted into a hosted web app
5131	1	a	please fix this bug once a passwordbox with an inputscopenumericpin is rendered the keyboard becomes stuck as a number pad and does not return to the full keyboard
5138	1	a	the new notification access is awesome but is it possible to add overlay ui and services you will find it under accessibility settings in android to rs
5151	1	a	i really want the universal apps to grow more powerful
5172	1	a	solution when open by a file type association the at least a simple dialog should ask allow access to all those filetypes or to the folder or only that file
5183	1	a	camera should work when app is minimized
2902	1	a	the idea is to segregate the user interface and business logic such that the user interface will execute on users machine outside of browserchrome as a standalone application
2925	1	a	make it easier to register for a background task
3146	1	a	there are a lot of upcoming features to help with fluent design and they are really great however to make full use of these the featuresxamlcontrols need to be backward compatible or do a fallback so that apps that do not target only the latest can also use this
3189	1	a	please review your package scanning portion of the application
3278	1	a	developers should have the option to optout instead of the option to optin
3280	1	a	having a device portal across all the different devices is a great idea
3320	1	a	please add an api that allows to read the temperature from the device
3327	1	a	please add an option to get rid of the fadein animation for opacity
3400	1	a	thats why markdowntextblock could offer a way to register some kind of callback function which is called whenever the control comes across a fenced code block with a specified language id
3412	1	a	all i am asking is when a new version of windows is released please keep the old vms still in there
3456	1	a	in fact we can use xed share with fonticon element without the enumeration
3505	1	a	it would be really cool if i could open a tcpip socket and by listening to the raw transmissions and resend events determine how good the network quality is
3511	1	a	the other side of the task should not even expect to notify someone of its progress unless the platform offers capabilities such as sql server xevent windows application event log or some form of notification
3534	1	a	it would also be good for tracking the causes of uninstall spikes etc
3554	1	a	it would be nice if for adaptive tiles with multiple groups where the current size cant fit all the groups those groups would automatically cycle around similar to msn news live tile or calendar app but in this case an individual notification would be cycling rather than a queue of separate notifications
3587	1	a	also it would be great to have the option for paid apps to be a subscription so users are charged periodically to continue using the app
3591	1	a	some apps could benefit from an easy way to not only send a toast notification but also maintain a notification history users could view afterwards
3615	1	a	implicit datatemplates not really an issue of the pivot but would be great to have these
3687	1	a	a control similar to the flowdocumentreader flowdocumentscrollviewer would be really awesome
3702	0	a	ive had to take ads out of my app to make it run and stop users complaining but now that means no income until this is fixed
3752	0	a	the control is the equivalent of a pivot table in excel you simply add the datasets with labels and the control sorts out all the selection fields visualizations and animations
3784	1	a	please expose undoredo functions on the textbox control so that we can trigger it programatically
3789	1	a	if would like to offer some guides to the user in our own application it could be interesting to have some interesting to be able to show a popup that give user some indication in the app in a precise scenario like when discovering a page the first time or when a new feature has been delivered
3793	1	a	allow to mix two app models javascriptwinjshtml and cxaml inside one application
3795	1	a	make scroll viewers and lists support gestures to scroll to bottom or to top at once
3838	0	a	so if a menu is displayed and the user moves the mouse over another menu without clicking the first menu would close and the new one hovered over would open
3878	0	a	in fact i wonder why ms does not support this fundamental feature while android and ios already does
3902	0	a	if you create a listview in an html uwp app you cant invoke an item after scolling trough it with your touchscreen
3955	1	a	allow the placement of rectangular items in d
3962	1	a	make autosuggestbox supports automationproperties for test automations and accessibility
3998	1	a	currently store access from windows is either enabled or disabled this really needs to be more granular
4007	1	a	i think that app should have two ratings one from windows phone users visible to people having windows phone and second one from windows mobile users visible to windows users
4030	0	a	in the appxmanifest one can only specify the default colors or a hex value
4031	1	a	there should be an option to enter accent to let the default splashscreen have the users accent color
4105	1	a	when using a listview bound to a collectionviewsource with grouped items it would be great to have the option to make the grouped item selectableinteractive
4122	0	a	with mouse flyout opens on right click which is ok
4134	1	a	if i have access to the fm radio apis i need the ability in my app to force audio to go through the speakers not the headphones
4164	1	a	i would like to programmatically set and get the volume for windows
4168	1	a	with windows mobile uwp and continuum microsoft is focusing on enterprise customers and developers so i think bringing vs to windows mobile through continuum can be game changer
4246	0	a	so that in theory our applications could report and find bugs for us
4303	1	a	it should also be possible to easily select the device where you want to play your system sounds but also to select two channels
4360	0	a	using the createrequestasync method of usercertificateenrollmentmanager and certificateenrollmentmanager classes i noticed that the certificatepropertiescollection does not give us the capability of specifying enhanced key usage oids for example smartcard logon secure email basic constraints like subject typeend entity or path length constraintnone nor the subject alternative name like rfc ds object guid ect
4429	0	a	i hope you will take this suggestion in consideration since this feature will be very useful and easy to implement by applications developers
4430	1	a	of course it would be even better to make xaml use typeconverter additionally for compatibilitys sake with wpf
4435	0	a	i already know workarounds using bindings but they are not practical they need more code and they are semantically incorrect a binding is not a transcodingconversion they are different by nature
4457	0	a	this gives you low latency input in case of a busy ui thread
4499	1	a	i think microsoft needs or boost xaml development or if it doesnt interest it open source it then the community can itself improve it
4505	1	a	please revise that value to px or provide better representation solution
4581	1	a	any media audiomidivideo generatorconsumer be it an app or an hardware device should be treated as a freely connectable node instead of an hardwired startingending point like today
4660	0	a	the documentation indicates that it should be possible to provide an environmentpermission for this to work but out of the box running this code in a uwp project never throws any of the listed exceptions if you dont specify the environmentpermission
4671	0	a	simple usage of the dnssd api results in the dns client service crashing
4720	1	a	extremely need password protected zipping and unzipping for universal app
4771	0	a	it would be much like the skype for desktops small call window that comes up when you are in a call
4780	1	a	wed be much happier if we could just avoid defining these macros entirely to avoid any possible issues
4820	0	a	an api that would take minutes for someone to write up and save me a lot of coding
4833	0	a	pedestrianfeaturesvisible cannot be disabled if mapstyle is set to aerialwithroads and cannot be enabled if is set to aerialdwithroads
4874	1	a	i belive its critical to make the minimize maximize and close buttons customizable for building a refined ui
4945	0	a	wpf apps work much better when ngend
4952	0	a	i liked the previous dev center where i could compare multiple apps on the same graph and just the look in general
4965	0	a	there should be a way to define them at once
4980	1	a	im sure making the interface public would save a number of developers a fair amount of effort and frustration
5034	0	a	it worked fairly well on wp but now on wm when you go to the start screen until the tile notification refreshes the live tile shows the default app tile
5066	0	a	i know i can get server certificates from the server once the request is done but it should have to be done just before sending the info in the same request
5110	1	a	please enhance launchfolderasync to accept any istorageitem file or folder as the first argument
5114	1	a	right now we cant able to assign itemssource to mapicon in here map for universal apps please allow to bind so can have easy to implement the apps having multiple map icons loads from database
5117	0	a	we have to provide different versions of our client application at the same time as converted app in the store
5133	0	a	for example if in the msi appx is added folder like samples or projects it cannot be found by the open save dialogs with set initial directory opened by the installed executable even if the folder is installed in the installed executables folder
5138	1	a	the new notification access is awesome but is it possible to add overlay ui and services you will find it under accessibility settings in android to rs
5147	0	a	it will make uwp more powerful like win and also let dev make some powerful and useful apps like universal copy and native clipboard
5157	1	a	there should be an option if the busness store settings that if checked will send the updated app to the new lob apps section under manage apps
5179	1	a	i wish that garbage collection was optional for c uwp apps
5228	1	a	add an easy to use and customizable ribbon control like the ones found in the office mobile apps that scales on pcs to phones
5230	1	a	there should be a powershell prompt in device portal that lets me run extra commands
5231	1	a	it should be possible to create visual studio centennial project in winforms wpf win mfc etc which should also allow mixing of uwp code like xaml ui with full interop between native and uwp platform
5244	1	a	ada has the ability to express pre and postconditions and add them in an easy manner if these were to be put into the apis you could block erroneous data from being passed into the apis function which in turn should make things more stable or at least give more meaningful errormessages than xff xf xcf and the like
5250	1	a	my suggestion is that microsoft create an cordova adcontrol and mediation plugin
5312	0	a	we frequently need to automate tests that run as different test users so that we can test workflow etc
5365	1	a	allow the developer to query windows store with restfull api service
5375	1	a	would be nice to have a market place where you can buy sample starters themes and plugins from independent developers
5379	1	a	now that microsoft has bought xamarin integrated it in visual studio and made it free it would be awesome to replace xamarinforms xaml syntax with current uwp so that devs can benefit from all the new rich features such as relativepanel xbind adaptive triggers live visual tree etc and also no learning curve for xamarinformsspecific naming conventions eg stacklayout instead of stackpanel
5380	1	a	id like to see support for having winappdriver log to a local file as well as support for setting log levels
5381	1	a	would be nice to have a market place of beautifully designed apps submitted by independent developers
5403	0	a	please let me know when you will add more payment options
5415	0	a	you could consider doing the same
5429	0	a	on the screen select the features you want to install if i select the windows software development kit feature at the bottom it installs gb worth of stuff including headers libraries and source code
5490	0	a	if there is no api to access this information enterprise application development with uwp becomes uninteresting
5492	1	a	something that would really give the mapcontrol a leg up over esri would be the ability to create a shapefile object and pass it as a parameter to something like mapelementcreateelementsfromshapefileshapefile and get a list of mapelements that could be added to the map
5502	1	a	at least please provide app price conversion list between usd and local currency
5513	0	a	think of foreign developers
5571	0	a	its better if we wake up early
5598	1	a	since most of us dont have a trademark on app names this should be forced by the store everybody will benefit with this developers and microsoft with a cleaner app store
5633	1	a	adding disqus to the windows blog would be a great way to improve developer engagement and build the windows developer community
5636	1	a	this suggestion is for the windows blog and is asking to improve its current commenting system by replacing it with disqus
5686	0	a	trying to bind to a uri will either throw an exception or give a compiler error i cant remember which and certainly wont display an image
5688	0	a	you can write your own converter for systemuri to an image source type but then you have to manually specify the converter on each binding plus you lose any performance tweaks ms may have made in their own converter
5701	1	a	it might make sense to have another method alongside requestverificationasync that allows consent verification via pin or password but there needs to be a way to request biometriconly consent verification
5726	0	a	would be great to have these bugs fixed soon
5856	1	a	for older browser that do not fully support es the code could be transpiled into es by babeljs traceur etc
5879	1	a	however it would be even better if it allowed users with the developer role to create app packages in visual studio
5889	1	a	i would expect the store to be capable of searching the partial words also or may be give an advance search option where people can tell where the word should be searched
6057	0	a	the only workaround provided by msft is to manually periodically wake up and reschedule a bunch of notifications ahead of time
6081	1	a	if microsoft really wants to get into the iot they should really support version with ipv communication over bluetooth
6109	0	a	start typing something in the search tab and try to scroll to the bottom most element while the inputpane is open you cant see the last element
6138	0	a	how to you intend your surface pro users to keep the surface steady with one hand while taking a look at the small preview and clicking on a small button with the other hand
6170	0	a	i have some great ideas and working on this since some weeks and when i tried to implement scheduling i was surprised to see that this is not available on windows
6207	1	a	please make support for setting set automationid on corewindows and messagedialog
6293	1	a	another even better option instead of adding the edit extensibility would be adding an open with option in the builtin photos app
6338	1	a	uwp really needs a way to handle masterdetails situations easily maybe something like uisplitviewcontroller offered in ios sdk
6370	0	a	this can give an app the false impression of being able to modify a nonapp calendar until a save is attempted and fails with unauthorized exception
6383	1	a	seeing as splitview is a control used to divide content between and pane and content area it would make sense for splitview to allow a paneplacementtop and paneplacementbottom in addition to its current left and right parameters
6405	1	a	i would like to recommend adding the ability to upload screenshots in x pixel size
6427	1	a	would be really helpful to have findancestor api added just like in silverlight and wpf
6429	1	a	back to how it was on the old dashboard would be ideal just a simple link to toggle between visible and hidden
6437	1	a	i suggest these new maximum lengths title characters description characters same as for app description
6447	1	a	you could also consider implementing this partially for example allow inheritance only between managed winrt classes and deriving managed classes from native winrt classes
6453	0	a	please modify like this
6455	0	a	you cannot submit any app during this period
6460	0	a	if you have any question please contact support
2	0	a	if we try to use one of those it answers with a parameter incorrect without any details
10	0	a	nevertheless user experience is very bad if the device state is always unknown upfront
61	0	a	consistency could be ruined if every dev needs to handle manual markup especially as the ui toolkit
69	0	a	the whiteboard app for example resizes graphic images with pinchstretch because they have fixed aspect ratios
73	0	a	example code which registers a service using windows dnssd apis
80	0	a	for example if i want to shut down or take a photo or search for dolphins or want to show the weather to the user or whatever from the uwp app itself
81	0	a	this way the app is very robust and flexible
99	0	a	this way as membership in a group changes the license assignment for app will automatically change
105	0	a	reason being i do my own d rendering without using directx for that video portion of my code just locking the screen directdraw surface for its parameters
108	0	a	however there is no toolkit available for affinity designer which is the only design program besides adobe xd that is available in the microsoft store
125	0	a	the error is in error
126	0	a	im okay with a friendly warning perhaps a glyph replacement
136	0	a	not only will this benefit both microsoft and samsung but put more power into the hands of the users and developers of both which are many many people
140	0	a	exactly as the title says
156	0	a	besides it will have a broader reach to consumers
159	0	a	to wrap this up i really have faith in what microsoft and doing and cortana while it needs improvement it can prove to be a great competitor that whats out in the market but being limited to few regions it just not useful and that sucks
169	0	a	i got several user feedback if i could provide a larger compact overlay
174	0	a	seems my users would prefer watching a video alwaysontop with a larger size
191	0	a	currently to interact with a datagrids rows you must specify a selectionchanged event
196	0	a	the wpf grid control had a showgridlines property
198	0	a	this property is missing in uwp
211	0	a	it looks that it removes something from the folder but it cannot
220	0	a	after a while the contents start moving but there is no way to move to the very top or very bottom using only the touchpadmousewheel
224	0	a	there seems to be a bug in dnssd where finished services are not actually getting unregistered
258	0	a	i liked windows version
260	0	a	i would like to try or maybe some of the rest of you have
267	0	a	as a developer i am constantly dropping new packages into the dev dashboard
270	0	a	bonus the cancel button on the upload operation doesnt appear to function either
276	0	a	as an early adopter of the platform i have a number of test apps andor games
281	0	a	some of these users are dirtbags and send me garbage feedback like asdfasdfasdf
287	0	a	i also created a few test groups i cant delete in the past as part of my exploration of the dashboard
295	0	a	the page indicates duplicate email addresses will be removed yet when i paste in duplicate email addresses they remain
325	0	a	press button show selected view as standalone and app is chrashing
326	0	a	what is the problem
333	0	a	im currently using a controller mapper like xpadder and joyxoff with my xbox controller
344	0	a	the latest os update to the hololens is missing key features for the commercial suite such as kiosk mode and others
353	0	a	your recent upgrade keep killing dwmexe which its caused display driver to died
356	0	a	most of us dont give a care about apple features we just want controllable situation and not wasting our time trying to delete virus that you recently given to us
363	0	a	no info regarding last update
6513	0	a	when you registered with wrong account you need to contact microsoft support and cancel it and needs to signup with correct microsoft account again
6534	1	a	allow rotationscaling of mapicons so that they stick relative to when the map is rotated
6538	1	a	also would like to place triggers at oom levels but that is a seperate issue
6540	1	a	it would be especially powerful and useful to be able to access the dom that is in the currently loaded page of the webview control and have full control over querying it and even modifying it if necessary
6556	1	a	if all variations could be merged i think most developers would be able to adjust to it and there would be less confusion in the future
6575	1	a	the best answer would be to simply exempt installed web apps from the group policy defaults for web pages
6584	1	a	and our customers would love to be able to install these apps without having to install firefox or chrome first
6603	1	a	for exemple the close button could be a top right triangle or larger cube
6635	1	a	the old format of showing up to screen shots side by side would give a user a better feel for the app as a whole
6647	1	a	another suggestion is to add another section at the bottom showing related apps as long as they meet a certain review standard to promote cross visibility
6672	1	a	we would prefer it either to show the apps page in the store or to not be included in the results at all if it appears to create an error
6680	1	a	i think you should provide the option to capture audio with an external mic via the mm jackand not through a bluethooth external mic
6683	1	a	when running a small ssd for your c drive the emulators can take up a large amount of space so it would be nice to move them to a second hard drive
6709	1	a	please make the theme beautiful by making the icons d
6719	1	a	instead of tiles we want something attractive for instance windows style icons more than initial screens customized taskbar the action and notification center should be glass style or in customized transparency style
367	0	a	unfortunately the api does not support that eg it logs off account when logging into account
369	0	a	api uses a webviewbased auth
371	0	a	there are a lot of mssettings commands to launch different settings pages from code on hololens but there is no way to call the utilities page under the sysem settings
373	0	a	our primary uwp app is currently compiled as x only because there are some limitations of c libs we use
374	0	a	weve discovered just today that webgl does not work in webview in uwp apps compiled as x on windows
375	0	a	any idea if this will be fixed in a cummulative update
377	0	a	when using menyflyoutshowatframeworkelement point with menuflyoutpresenter style with rounded corners or other semitransparency unwanted white background is shown under it in windows
378	0	a	this was not happening before on windows or earlier
379	0	a	our app is using menuflyout with shadow effect a lot so its causing us lot of headache right now
380	0	a	the treeview from windows update lacks the possibility to select a ceirtain treeviewnode from code
382	0	a	mouse sensors and other similar harware devices
383	0	a	for user the sensors are the different places and ways to touch in space having xyz coordinates like
385	0	a	this is the second question with kind of hardware device is use to
388	0	a	and when you type glyphuri in the vs xaml editor and type equal sign it pops up an opinions menu to open a fonticon wizard
390	0	a	when you select either on it automtically adds the font to a folder under your project called fonts that you can specify using a msappx resource path
396	0	a	if you open the fonticon wizard it looks similar to the old windows charmap application except it also has an extra button called manage fonts when you click it you get a font management page that lets you add new font from your harddisk download a new font from nugetetc more
398	0	a	the document said that occurs when the user invokes the system button for close the x button in the corner of the apps title bar
399	0	a	but when user tapping x button on sets window the event not raised correctly
402	0	a	because a lot of user post a bug report to the app review on the microsoft store
415	0	a	the launchuriforresultsasync method works fine
416	0	a	but we cant change the size of the window that is opened
417	0	a	it is always x
419	0	a	this prevents us from using this api
421	0	a	when running a uwp app on win desktop i am able to add two timedtextcues to a timedmetadatatrack with the same starttime but on mobile it results in a crash
422	0	a	im guessing this is a bug because it doesnt produce an understandable exception
423	0	a	if i add the cues to the track before adding the track to mediasourceexternaltimedmetadatatracks the crash happens when adding the track
424	0	a	i reproduced this on mobile emulator wxga inch gb and on a lumia running
434	0	a	windowsdevicesserialcommunicationserialdevice cant receive data in some cases
438	0	a	comment lines from to where serial device settins read
446	0	a	connect to port and try to send data to it
447	0	a	you will see that await loadasynctask never ends
449	0	a	the last three days i was working hard to solve a problem submitting our uwp app to the store
450	0	a	now i know why it was not working and i want to make my knowledge public
453	0	a	we have an uwp app targeting windows fall creators update which was published successfully to the sore previously
454	0	a	a new version fails the certification process with app crash or freeze
456	0	a	side loadable release builds are also starting and working on our build and test machines
458	0	a	this package contains our code compiled with the native tool chain
463	0	a	this package does always crash after side loading it
464	0	a	so this crash is not the problem reported by the certification process
465	0	a	now things are very complicated
466	0	a	the uploaded appxupload package contains the net dlls which are compiled via the native tool chain on the microsoft certification server which generates a package which fails at startup
467	0	a	the same build process on my developer machine with the locally installed native tool chain generates perfectly loadable builds
468	0	a	unfortunately there are no more details available from the certification process
469	0	a	also microsoft support could not help me
470	0	a	they build a package which fails without details and i can not download the build package for debugging
473	0	a	the testflight certification process builds the same package internally
474	0	a	fortunately it does not try to start the build as part of the certification process
475	0	a	so i was able to install the test flight package on my local machine for debugging
476	0	a	and it crashed at startup
478	0	a	using some gflags and vs i was able to find that the entry point for formatmessage was not found
479	0	a	entry point for formatmessage not found after some searching i found this and yes i was using this library with the old version
482	0	a	so the native tool chain compiles against the wrong entry point which causes the app crash at startup
483	0	a	but why was it working on my local machine
484	0	a	this is because i am using visual studio which has already fixed the problem
485	0	a	unfortunately the build infrastructure of microsoft which is used for the uwp certification process at least for our targeted os version windows falls creators update uses the buggy version of the supportedapisx
487	0	a	after i used the latest version of pinvokekerneldll which contains a workaround for the problem all was fine
490	0	a	the microsoft build server for submitted uwp packages is using a buggy cprogram files xwindows kitsapp certification kitsupportedapisx
492	0	a	local release builds created with the native toolchain of vs are working
493	0	a	here the supportedapisx
498	0	a	i hope this helps
503	0	a	maybe it will help someone
507	0	a	debug build of the app is starting and working on our developer machine
511	0	a	notice datauri property and resource path msappx pointing to svg file added to visual studio project under an svg folder
514	0	a	then mybuttontxt can contain getting the msappx path correct and not mistyped is a serious pain in the neck thats why microsoft should let people drag and drop them from their project tree in msappx path format
519	0	a	for windowsml and machinelearningnet applications we need to monitor processor usage specificly by ai processes in task manager
522	0	a	after a trial has expired the expiration date is set to
531	0	a	previously this is messy because it requires setting from c code to measure height of font and multiply by number of lines to set textbox height from code
532	0	a	my approach is xaml and doesnt require messy calculations
534	0	a	when heightline then the height is set with height property
536	0	a	the default value for heightline can be set to by default to maintain backwards compatibility
539	0	a	not everybody cares about drawing pixels on a paper and placing everything that way line numbers is enough for a control panel type setttings page
548	0	a	it is not clear in what order i should check these properties to allow a user to continue
549	0	a	lets say i have a couple of views and their related viewmodels
550	0	a	the viewmodels have some common logic and common properties that id like to put in a base view model class to not repeat myself
551	0	a	and if i have viewmodels deriving from my base view model and my base view model has the boolean isloading property i want to be able to xbind to this isloading property from each view
552	0	a	several members of returned json from twitters api are missing from the servicestwitter implementation
553	0	a	this returns the full url of a tco shortened url in a tweet
555	0	a	the title of the url as displayed in the url card on the tweet
557	0	a	for quote tweets a parameter named quotedstatus returns information about a quoted tweet
560	0	a	winrt is littered with async getters that greatly impede porting code and add unnecessary complexity for many cases
562	0	a	when ive already created a dedicated thread anyway off the main ui for processing i dont need nor want winrt apis spawn even more threads
564	0	a	although the intentions of increased threading throughput are respectable focus on writing apis that are foremost developer friendly

595	0	a	trackpad activities are not unified across different controls
597	0	a	however we cant do the same thing in map control or in photos app

608	1	a	i would like to have adp sink profile on windows specially on iot core i know that most of the times is related to the drivers of the bt chip but citing your site the following rfcomm services are not supported
612	0	a	audio source xa and sink xb
615	0	a	its usage would be similar to selectedforeground and selectedborderbrush

618	0	a	i experienced problem with uwp listview particularly using isupportincrementalloading interface as a datasource
619	0	a	a few words about problem context
620	0	a	in our uwp app there is a listview and it uses isupportincrementalloading as a datasource
621	0	a	and while next part of data is loading listview is disabled
622	0	a	so the problem in that if you scroll listview in way you catch scrollbar and pull it to the down
623	0	a	when you scroll to the end of the list listview will be disabled for some period of time while data is loading
624	0	a	and if you release mouse button from scrollbar
625	0	a	while listview is blocked then some strange behavior of scrollbar appears after listview became enabled
626	0	a	you cannot hover mouse on scrollbar because when try to do it scrollbar goes upper
629	0	a	note ive got success with experiencing this problem in uwp app created from scratch used listview and isupportincrementalloading
630	0	a	id like to attach sample app but i dont understand how of course if it possible
631	0	a	note if discard of using isupportincrementalloading
632	0	a	the problem exists but a bit another kind of

643	0	a	unable to prevent auto close of inputpane which is creating issue due to a possible bug of inputpane in uwp with target version on tablet
645	0	a	for opening inputpane for nd input element you have to tap outside to lose focus then you will have to tap that input again which will focus input and will open inputpane as its focused now through tapping not by tab button of inputpane
646	0	a	this issue has been many times on stack overflow but its still answered
659	0	a	for i like that the backbutton is now builtin to the navigationview control
660	0	a	however the placement of the button looks terrible next to the hamburger button
661	0	a	i was actually excited to see it was built into the nav control because i cant figure out where to place the backbutton either such that it doesnt look weird and out of place but the builtin nav backbutton doesnt solve the problem either it still look weird and extreme beta
662	0	a	currently theres a set of com apis that provide access to virtual desktoprelated features like pinning apps to desktops switching desktops etc
663	0	a	unfortunately most of it is undocumented and does not seem to be stabilized spring update for instance changed iapplicationviews clsid so apps using it stopped working

675	0	a	windows is the only platform that doesnt support this natively
676	0	a	even the iphone has had this for almost eight years
677	0	a	i have been experiencing tons of system crashes recently so i disabling my thirdparty loopback driver to see if it helps but this means i lose this functionality
678	0	a	not having these apis means i cannot as a developer make an app that uses the surface touch screen to control music software
680	0	a	android and ios have popular apps that do this
681	0	a	raspberry pi and arduino have countless midi projects on github
682	0	a	windows is literally the only platform that restricts musicians in this way
690	0	a	raspberry pi and arduino have countless midi projects on more
692	0	a	datapackageoperationcompleted is not raised at least when pasting text

718	0	a	often the same command is available in an app through different ways
719	0	a	it might be placed in a menuflyout in a button in a appbarbutton
721	0	a	the problem is that all these controls have different properties for the text content
722	0	a	all with the same original and translated text for all languages
723	0	a	it is pretty annoying having to duplicate lots or resources just becase the same command has now moved to a different control
734	0	a	currently you cannot create an emitter unless you are using k wave audio
735	0	a	back in directsound you could do lr panning with any wave samplerate
736	0	a	one of the benefits of migrating to audiograph is support for mp other files but if you want do panning you still have to convert them first
740	0	a	i am looking after a solution already over a decade for d mouses working over windows remote desktop connection
741	0	a	still today d mouses usbconnected to the local computer and used over a remote desktop connection to external server are not working properly
742	0	a	on the field there are hundreds of cad industrial designers and other engineers still not able to use a d mouse on the remote server over microsoft rdc
743	0	a	normal mouses are working fine but d mouse such a spacenavigator from d connexion is only able to zoom over rdc
745	0	a	other competitors such as citrix and hp have already solved this issue with their own remote desktop clients
756	0	a	would still keep the instance property to prevent breaking changes

779	0	a	ive also posted the full exception there
780	0	a	transferring large amounts of data kb takes way to long when transferred via ble using native windows functionality as the min connection interval seems to be quite large
781	0	a	using an bledongle via hci where it is

784	0	a	not able to retrieve mac address of device
788	0	a	without a header attribute for the button control it looks like and doesnt line up
791	0	a	that would be sort of like going to starbucks and telling the casher person to leaving room for cream in your coffee where the cream layer is for your headers
792	0	a	the reason why button needs a header attribute is because if i make a grid of a textbox with header field set and a place a button next to it it looks likes like without the header padding to push the button down
797	0	a	in the case where no bing maps data is being used eg
799	0	a	ideally some way to disable the bing maps access explicitly plus some smart watermark ie ms resolution
807	0	a	i believe there is progress coming way for this issue already but i want to post it just to show my desire for it
808	0	a	i am attempting to use lsof to find an open port for an application but rather it returns sock cant identify protocol
809	0	a	this occurs because procnettcp is empty and thus the socket cannot be identified as tcp
811	0	a	i selected a set of rd party drivers and my computer immediately failed to boot

815	0	a	the new winrt midi apis are broken and have been since their introduction with no sign of plans to be fixed
816	0	a	in addition the functionality they provide is still lacking compared to other platforms
817	0	a	there is information on this in the other midi topics on this page and on github if you do an issue search for winrt midi or uwp midi
819	0	a	delete all universal windows platform
820	0	a	there is no way to get battery usage of system display wifi mobile data etc
821	0	a	but this details are available in battery use settings
823	0	a	currently it only supports touch input
824	0	a	i appreciate that swipe controls have come out of developments around touch interfaces
826	0	a	microsoft have set precedent for this in their own apps
827	0	a	outlook for example utilises a swipecontrol type arrangement that can be interacted with using a mouse for marking emails as read or unread among other things
836	0	a	and i have a problem with windows explorer that it breaks every time when i try to move from one screen to another
837	0	a	i just figured out what was the problem and i can work with it without any problem but i want to post it to see if it can be fixed for another user
838	0	a	how to emulate the bug
842	0	a	now with the mouse pointer click on the title of the window and move it to the second screen
843	0	a	the problem that i get is that the window will flash and crash the solution is to close it in the taskbar restart the explorer process
845	0	a	then when you move the screen it will not have the same problem
846	0	a	i have a windows notebook with a second screen
850	0	a	open windows explorer

876	0	a	my customer i am an office consultant are struggling with the adoption of this new way of working because of simple things like this that annoy and takes minutes per person per working spot
878	0	a	the following example doesnt show an error in the designer but throws errors in the generated code
883	0	a	the above case is trying to subtract from the width of another element but clamp it within a specific range
892	0	a	currently it seems to be sorted by unicode code points which doesnt make any sense for chinese characters at least
893	0	a	i have a disk imaging application which i have already converted that writes bytes directly to disk usb and sd cards
894	0	a	it requires admin rights to get a lock on the disk
897	0	a	there are thousands of apps out there that probably arent converted for similar reasons
902	0	a	test apps although hidden in the store undergo the same certification process
905	0	a	the submission process for test apps takes too long
910	0	a	i have been trying to get my son into programming and so far his dev experience has been less than exciting
911	0	a	he wants to debug his game real time but the emulator is a pain to deal with forces and gps etc
912	0	a	allegedly this works however i have found thread after thread of people looking for a real solution but no one appears to make any headway because vs gives useless feedback
913	0	a	i have spent an entire day trying to get something anything working
914	0	a	if i choose device i get a generic error vie tried every suggestion i can find online if i choose remote machine i am prompted for a pin so i go into the for devs page on my device and i hit pair and i get a digit pin
915	0	a	that pin doesnt work though so the pin screen wont go away
916	0	a	i was able to finally build an app package that i can manually move o the device in the portal but i shouldnt have to do that and it breaks the debug chain

930	0	a	i am active windows insider users currently enrolled to receive the fastest windows inside builds
931	0	a	i currently use cortana each day on windows android and iphone
935	0	a	i have noticed that sometimes the microphone function on the iphone and android app tends to stall or freeze
936	0	a	it doesnt matter if i set the microphone to open upon application launch or activate the microphone the delay in time the user has to wait to speak to cortana is quite noticeable
938	0	a	i understand the limitations of apple so its unlikely the user will be able to respond to a text message directly on a windows pc

958	0	a	i have a driver causing a memory leak
960	0	a	poolmon is not offered as a standalone tool and only as part of the windows driver kit so i must download the entire windows driver kit to access this one small tool
961	0	a	in order to download the windows driver kit i must first install visual studio
962	0	a	i am not going to download multiple gbs of that i will never use to fix a memory leak
963	0	a	that just turns my memory leak issue into a harddrive bloat issue
965	0	a	thanks for nothing microsoft
967	0	a	microsofts official support reccomends that i use a tool called poolmon to find which driver is causing the leak
974	0	a	scenario an application saving different file formats with the same file extension example choices for txt files when saving with excel ms office
975	0	a	case tested when using filesavepicker with uwp even if the application adds different choices with the same file extension then it is not possible to know which of those choices the user actually selected
976	0	a	filesavepicker just returns a storagefile class for the file name and extension
977	0	a	issue i developed a desktop application saving files with different formats with the same file extension using savefiledialog and filterindex and currently uwp would not allow me to convert the application from desktop without adding additional menu options or dialogs so the user can chose what heshe wants
978	0	a	this means adding more steps to select something that is already shown on the filesavepicker dialog which i think it would eventually affect in a way the user experience

984	0	a	you know it for sure one developer produces great software like google chrome paintnet or many others
985	0	a	the other developers try to force customers to use their software for example m with edge and paint d
986	0	a	m even tries to pay customers to use bing edge
990	0	a	if necessary you could send your incompetent product managers to the competitors at least at school so the can learn how great software has to feel and look like
992	0	a	m just displays lines
993	0	a	it feels like m is begging the customers to send no feedback because m hates it but must do something
1000	0	a	this is the crezy idea
1001	0	a	m could try again to develop great software again as many years before which your customers want to install themselves because its just fun to work with and it brings great benefits to users
1007	1	a	how about letting the user decide whether my people should use these animated notifications or normal toasts

1020	0	a	but there are still times when you want to install some things
1021	0	a	i also understand that this will be something that software manufacturers will be requesting to ms directly
1033	0	a	with f still not providing a way to code a full application for the desktop using uwp after several years of people waiting i want to call for bringing common lisp to the platform
1035	0	a	machines now have the power to really make lisp shine and show all it can do to empower uwp developers to create amazing solutions
1040	0	a	the users that are already subscribed to the addon will keep the same price as before but the new users will get the new price
1041	0	a	whats the reason that currently microsoft is blocking a price increase
1042	0	a	its not really convenient for developers to create every time a new addon when they want to increase the price
1043	0	a	we tried to embrace microsofts vision for uwp but failed misreably wasting lots of time and money
1044	0	a	we built a uwp application that reads public data off iso smart cards successfully until we realized that the app fails to function in release mode
1045	0	a	in debug mode it all works fine
1046	0	a	in release mode we generate the appx and it passes windows certification
1047	0	a	the smartcard functionality however which is based on a net standard library fails to work
1048	0	a	we are now trying to use the native uwp smartcard api but its largely useless as we cannot find any methods to construct and transmit apdu which are the basic communication block
1050	0	a	for now we have no option but to rebuild the app to a nonmicrosoft environment
1057	0	a	the wireless card worked well till windows
1058	0	a	now this is a mess
1059	0	a	intel says they cannot give update

1099	0	a	this is so ridiculous that windows update doesnt have any rule and there is no way believe me i googled a lot to allow it securely without allowing whole svhostexe even spotify has a default rule
1101	0	a	im using lates windows edition build
1103	0	a	please dont reply me with this
1104	0	a	there is no way for adding dns names in windows firewall and also it is not secure
1105	0	a	also please dont reply me with answers under this
1106	0	a	i already tried renaming svhostexe with no luck
1110	0	a	i changed the windows firewall default to block anything without a rule
1116	0	a	both process isolation and hyperv isolation for containers are available in windows server but windows only supports hyperv isolation
1117	0	a	hyperv isolation has benefits but also has many drawbacks such as resource allocation performance as well as stability
1118	0	a	a simple check of the docker for windows issues board shows a large imbalance of windows and hyperv isolation related issued where the windows server issues are much less common
1125	0	a	hello i want to protect some usermode code and read only data against other usermode modification from a kernelmode driver while allowing process handle creation
1126	0	a	mmsecurevirtualmemoryagainstwrites seems to do the job but its undocumented and not even exported
1127	0	a	in my enterprise application basically a sales and purchase application
1128	0	a	currently uwp allow rendertargetbitmap api to render framework element in xaml to image which currently in viewed in screen
1129	0	a	but in my case i want to print receipt and dont want to show the receipt in the screen and just pass the bitmap image of receipt to pos printer
1130	0	a	but rendertargetbitmap api doesnt work in background
1136	0	a	in uwp xaml binding something that is not an icommand to an event gives an exception in the xaml compiler wcm object reference not set to an instance of an object
1139	0	a	i would expect it to catch this an give a readable error message about an invalid binding idealy the propertyname and the control type at least
1140	0	a	something that lets you investigate
1141	0	a	using microsoft gift cards as developer account registration fee
1142	0	a	well its really powerful for indie devs
1143	0	a	lets say there is a app which display news stories
1144	0	a	the app does not want to have too many stories on the screen and load stories on demand
1145	0	a	the first time the app is opened it downloads news article and displays say the top to user in a listview and rest are stored locally
1146	0	a	these are displayed if the user scrolls down incremental loading collection helpers are great addition
1147	0	a	now lets say next day the app is opened again
1148	0	a	app immediately displays yesterdays news stories and works in background to load new stories or user pulls to refresh
1149	0	a	as soon as new stories are downloaded they are added at the from of the listview not all but say top and rest goes to the diskcache
1150	0	a	now if user scrolls down more stories are fetched from the cachedisk
1162	0	a	on windows uwp apps if you rapidly click or unintentionally doubleclick on any control supporting clicktapped event its associated click event handler will execute for each
1163	0	a	this can cause a lot of unintended side effects
1164	0	a	for example if the click event handler brings up a modal contentdialog with the showasync command an additional click will cause the event handler to fire again before modal isolation occurs and create another contentdialog which causes an exception if not handled will result in a crash of the application
1167	0	a	tablet version microsoft windows version
1171	0	a	target version windows build
1179	0	a	it used to do this in windows and early windows versions but this apparently changed a while ago
1184	0	a	this will be a good addition
1186	0	a	it is understandable that when uwp app is run normally it can only access a limited set of com objects however if the uwp is packaged to desktop bridge it makes sense to allow it to access additional com objects exposed by that desktop bridge using the technical described in the blog above
1187	0	a	without this support if a desktop bridge contains a uwp app and a win app exposes outofproc com objects the only way uwp app can communicate with the win app is through appservice
1188	0	a	this brings a lot of overhead and unnecessary work to add appservice into win app and sometimes it is impossible if win source code is not available
1190	0	a	packaged com allows exposing outofproc com objects using desktop bridge however these com objects are not accessible from uwp apps even if the uwp apps are packaged into same desktop bridge exposes the com objects
1194	0	a	we are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated xbox apps
1195	0	a	it used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on xbox which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high
1196	0	a	now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on xbox and by default every windows app that is published is published on all devices
1197	0	a	i know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device but it means that when we publish an app now our app is barely out a day and it is pushed way down the new apps list making it almost impossible to generate organic downloads from curious users
1198	0	a	that is fine if we are being kept out by other xbox apps but we released an app last week and currently there are about dozens apps ahead of us half that wont even work on an xbox with a controller
1199	0	a	it is totally crazy and really counterproductive to building any kind of a vibrant ecosystem
1200	0	a	one simple example is there is a pdf database app on the new apps list on xbox
1201	0	a	you cannot use it it cannot access files and it has absolutely no viable function on xbox one
1202	0	a	yet somehow this passes certification and is thrown on the pile of rubbish that now clutters the new app section
1204	0	a	it is hugely frustrating to put months of work into building an app for xbox and stand no chance of getting it downloaded because nobody will ever be able to find it
1209	0	a	i know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device
1210	0	a	currently desktop bridge supports in app purchases
1212	0	a	as of now there is no good ad network for existing desktop applications
1213	0	a	this feature is almost available in any web based video player or any desktop based video player the feature is simple
1214	0	a	when a mediaplayerelement is playing or paused a video
1215	1	a	and the user hover overs the seekbar with mouse or pen or any other input device for that perspective wherver is the user mouse show a small thumbnail of the video file at that specific position just above the seekbar slider and as the user moves the mouse along the seekbar the thumbnail should update accordingly
1217	0	a	im aware of the sandboxing
1222	1	a	in uwp applications with the codegeneration manifest capability allow the use of the existing exception table apis currently marked desktoponly
1223	0	a	on uwp for x arm and arm its not possible to comply with the windows abi when generating code at runtime because you cannot generate the mandatory exception table data for the dynamicallygenerated code
1235	0	a	otherwise this function is useful to runtime code generation
1240	0	a	so i uninstalled kb became build
1241	0	a	retry desktop app converter was successes
1242	0	a	i think that it is the problem of baseimage and kb
1243	0	a	of course version build can use the dac
1244	0	a	currently microsoft store under windows shows three types of information
1248	0	a	but theres no numerical value representing the amount of data that will have to be downloaded
1249	0	a	please fix this annoying issue
1251	0	a	many applications need only desktop support
1252	0	a	uwp is too safe so as to be impractical for so many desktop apps and wpf is like a thirdclass citizen with microsoft in the background cheering upgrade to uwp
1253	0	a	the sandbox nonsense has to go
1257	0	a	let them install it if they so choose
1258	0	a	of the applications they install arent and wont be sandboxed uwp applications anyway
1270	0	a	but it is not available by default
1272	0	a	im using file explorer but if can seee my otler drives like d drive ore e drive ts gona be more handfull
1273	0	a	calcbinding is an advanced binding markup extension that allows you to write calculated binding expressions in xaml without custom converters
1274	0	a	calcbinding can automatically perform bool to visibility conversion inverse your expression and more
1275	0	a	calcbinding makes binding expressions shorter and more userfriendly
1276	0	a	this is only available for wpf
1277	0	a	here are some examples
1285	0	a	right now its possible to define apps for websites using app uri handlers
1287	0	a	these excludepaths feature supports only path matching right now not wildcards for the whole uri
1290	0	a	uwp combobox is not showing the selected value under certain resolutions
1292	0	a	in visual studio if i select the container a grid and change something like the flow from horizontal to vertical the redraw fixes the issue which leads me to believe that its the render
1293	0	a	we use the create date on log files to check if they can be deleted
1294	0	a	the problem is that when we delete that file and recreate it same filename the create date stays the same
1296	0	a	how to reproduce
1298	0	a	it creates a testlog file
1301	0	a	run the code again
1304	0	a	the testlog file is created again
1305	0	a	check the create on the testlog it still has the create date from the first time you ran the code
1308	0	a	run this as many times as you like the create date will not change from the first time you ran the code
1319	0	a	it deletes the file
1325	1	a	having sockseqpacket would remove the burden of distinguishing between independent messages from the user
1326	0	a	it also allows greater compatibility for existing posixcompatible applications as was the original goal for implementing afunix
1327	0	a	this would be comparable to the message mode of windows named pipes making afunix sockets a more complete replacement
1329	0	a	some users certainly will find this useful
1331	0	a	sadly if youre someone who finds this annoying theres no option to disable this behavior
1332	0	a	according to the singular post i was able to find on this new feature there is no way to disable this
1334	0	a	the new fall creators update seems to have introduced a feature where if a user reboots the system any applications that were open well some at least it seems as though to make this issue even more confusing not all applications follow this convention will automatically launch on reboot
1336	0	a	others may find this annoying
1341	0	a	it currently only supports octetstream
1342	0	a	in trying to use sha timestampcurrent microsoft guidelines servers the powershell cmdlet setauthenticodesignature fails to apply the timestamp
1343	0	a	this cmdlet uses the cryptuiwiz api
1344	0	a	heres the sample script to reproduce the error
1348	0	a	actually we cant because the same notification would be send too if the user is closing the application
1352	0	a	this issue was reported for visual studio feedback site but they have determined that this issue belongs to universal windows platform
1353	0	a	currently we have no notifying system to the developers when the customer add new feedback to the feedback hub
1355	0	a	its tooo painful
1356	1	a	is it possible to add the notification system
1358	0	a	uservoice already have it
1361	0	a	its a control carryover from as far back as w w linux mac system systems have never had this issue
1362	0	a	create a new blank uwp application and add this xaml code
1364	0	a	when i run this i expect to get no suggestions in the software keyboard when writing anything in the text box
1365	0	a	this works as expected on phones but not on computerstablets
1366	0	a	im using fall creators update not sure how it behaves in other versions
1368	0	a	in my case i am writing an app where you learn how to spell and dont want to give the user any hints
1376	0	a	we are developing components on linux which has dedicated system call and memory requests
1378	0	a	this would signify communication and access on the file system
1381	0	a	i have some more feature recommendations regarding extensions in adaptivegridview if you will
1384	0	a	and which operator to use andor in case of multiple property filter provided
1386	0	a	and this grouping will obviously include the semantic zoom feature as well
1387	0	a	incremental loading i know this is already in the community toolkit
1389	0	a	sorting sorting with or more properties
1390	1	a	listgridswitcher there can be a toggle button on the top of the control which can toggle the control to view as a listview each item expanded fully or to a gridview normal grid like behaviour
1391	0	a	these are some of the most common scenarios which are required by developers and there are many ways to do it but this can get very complicated to align them with best practices
1394	0	a	this can be a very powerful controlpage yet looking very good to the eye as well
1397	0	a	this search bar auto filters the items on basis of the filterdescriptor provided filter descriptor can be defined by the developer tht which stringtimeint property to match with which condition ie contains startswith endswith etc
1401	0	a	i have used unityuwp to develop lob application that visualizes d data from opened files
1402	0	a	we also use multipletoplevel windows that are already available
1403	0	a	now client wants to allow opening and visualizing multiple files which would have been easy with win just launch another instance
1405	0	a	i have a disk imaging which i have already converted application that writes bytes directly to disk usb and sd cards
1407	0	a	the app gets rejected during submission to the store as some features are disabled as admin privileges are required
1411	0	a	so in a round about way youre actually raising the chances of users getting viruses by blocking these apps as they just get them from the web instead
1418	0	a	current clipboard api can notify about a clipboard content change which is fine
1421	0	a	this limitation results in a bad user experience because there are scenarios where the user is working with one application and another application performs some operations based on the copied content
1429	0	a	but getting or setting the content doesnt work if the app is in background or unfocused
1432	0	a	or the other way around where one application creates data and sets the content automatically and the user can directly use it inside another application
1437	0	a	currently the input will be validated if the focus of the textbox lost
1445	0	a	i can verify that this works
1446	0	a	but unfortunately it is not possible to create a mediastreamsample from dd surface
1449	0	a	this will allow us to do full hardware accelerated video decoding
1450	0	a	xbind is great and i love it
1456	0	a	this limit appears to be arbitrary and not on par with other platforms ios android mac osx
1457	0	a	this limitation is a contribution to a diminished user experience and developer experience when compared to these other platforms
1459	0	a	this idea is so bad on so many levels
1460	0	a	so what is the suggestion
1463	0	a	as a xamarinforms developer i had to drill down frameworks to find this limitation
1464	0	a	as bad as the android docs are they at least make an effort to publish limits
1465	0	a	do not suggest a steam roller as a work around to a shortcoming in a fly swatter
1466	0	a	especially if that steam roller is riddled with security issues and complexity way beyond the experience and latitude of most fly swatter users
1467	0	a	in this following forum post the character limit for an email body generated via code from an app is noted
1476	0	a	contentdialog is currently far too difficult to use for two reasons locking and placement
1479	1	a	since only one contentdialog can be shown at a time a lock is needed such as semaphoreslim or a sequential queue of taskcompletionsource
1480	0	a	in other words the class is not complete because normal use of it requires wrapping it in additional code
1482	0	a	this means that contentdialogshowasync will wait until any currentlydisplayed contentdialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog
1485	0	a	if showasync or showasync contentdialogplacementpopup is used then the location of the dialog is not well controlled
1487	0	a	on the other hand if showasync contentdialogplacementinplace is used then a it is not convenient because one must separately embed the dialog in xaml and b it doesnt always work because an exception occurs if showasyncinplace is called on the dialog before the xaml is fully loaded
1488	0	a	for example an error dialog that is required early during program startup cannot be shown based on a copy embedded in xaml
1490	0	a	in addition per above a lock of some kind is needed
1502	0	a	currently when the last elements of the tile doesnt fit because of users with unusual scaling settings for example it gets discarded out of view which is understandable
1504	0	a	it also helps with dealing with the scenario where because of the users scaling settings there is too much space on the tile where the developer could have shown extra info
1505	0	a	passwordvaultfindallbyresource throws a comexception when there are no credentials for the resource or maybe only when there are no credentials
1506	0	a	it should return an empty list without throwing an exception
1507	0	a	right now the windowclosed event for desktop fires both for minimization and for closing events
1508	0	a	i understand this is done because of the multiplatform support but it just makes desktop apps with multiple windows harder o manage so please
1510	0	a	a good web example can be found here
1512	0	a	we are able to download previous versions of the release versions of the windows sdk
1514	0	a	on the slow ring we are currently on windows build but the only sdk download link provided on the windows insider download page is for at time of writing
1515	0	a	i am not willing to go to fast ring because this renders my laptop useless
1518	0	a	when you invoke the primary or secondary buttons in a contentdialog you are not losing focus in the control that was last being edited
1519	0	a	if you are using xbind to bind that controls value to a property in the contentdialog codebehind page then when you press the primary button the property doesnt get updated
1520	0	a	ive tried forcing the control in this case a textbox to lose focus programmatically in the primary buttonevent handler but this does not help
1521	0	a	ive also tried bindingsupdate bit this does not help either
1527	0	a	the expected behaviour is that when you click on the primary
1528	0	a	i cant register dev account because of living in republic of moldova
1530	0	a	there are thousands of programmists here too
1531	0	a	currently there does not appear to be a way to set a windows startup position left top widthright heightbottom beyond fullscreen andor maximized
1532	0	a	also the last used position for a given window isnt saved intrinsically
1533	0	a	windows launch at random places on the desktop
1534	0	a	i understand this need does not really exist for mobile
1535	0	a	but for many desktop applications specifically container applications managing windows is a core feature objective
1536	0	a	it is similar like this issue
1537	0	a	weve inherit a control from slider and put it in horizontal
1538	0	a	if windows set to dpi and when slider value is the same as its maximum value
1539	0	a	our app would crash
1540	0	a	if we use applicationexecutablepath when the user open the shortcut he gets an access permission error so i am trying to create it using shellappsfolder but i cant get the appusermodelid
1541	0	a	im on a desktopbridge app and when i try to use windowsapplicationmodelappinfo its null
1544	0	a	setting protextedtext to on doesnt work the selected text is still modifiable
1547	0	a	editor is the value of xname given to richeditbox element
1550	0	a	rotatortiles behavior is like an automated flipview
1553	0	a	microsoft has added in the camera app the panorama mode which works in some devices and tablets
1554	0	a	dont know if it is a specific number of devices that currently this feature works
1556	0	a	is this possible to use this feature in our windows app store universal apps and if we can do we have any sample code to accomplish this
1557	0	a	dont want a solution with the scrollviewer and the compass because i have already done that
6720	1	a	the app list should be in grid style and background should be customized
6721	1	a	the keyborad should also be customized like the gadget comfort onscreen keyboard in windows desktop
6724	1	a	please allow us to maintain all app packages store assets descriptions screenshots and metadata in a git repository and simply push to a git remote to upload
6728	1	a	instead we could get everything ready locally and do a push and upload it all quickly
6732	1	a	what i would like to see is a button on the language description pages that are supported for an app
6737	0	a	and put it onto the description field for japanese for example for my app i have it in about languagecountry descriptions which is a big task to handle
6738	0	a	the user could then review the translations as best as they could
6739	0	a	and if microsoft couldnt translate it it could just copy over the original text
6742	0	a	that would take your default language description and fields and then use microsofts translator to translate all the fields to the language
6745	1	a	please add support ccx extension and type system for desktop platform
6750	1	a	and its good if it will be work on windows too
6757	1	a	please comment and document this behavior
6760	1	a	therefore i want to request adding of some improvements in winrt api to bring frames behavior closer to its analog from wp silverlight
6780	0	a	so would be great if microsoft things in this way also
6782	0	a	it should be typed as it is typed in gujarati
6788	1	a	it would be great to have a background trigger when that data was changed on another device
6799	1	a	it is great that we can schedule tile updates so that i can always show the latest timings on the tile itself but i would love it if i could do the same thing with badges
6806	0	a	attempting to use textalignment within pageresources and referencing it via staticresource in a universal windows app will compile but throw an exception
6809	1	a	when cortana has an expression that it doesnt understand based on the available expressions registered but cortana does recognize an app name it would be great if the users expression was fed to the app account on the store for the developer to review and consider supporting in the future
6818	1	a	window should stay the size i left it
6831	1	a	please add can api to be included in the windowsdevices
6837	0	a	companies like cshtml and duocode are already doing this but it would be great to see this effort officially adopted into the microsoft universal windows platform
6841	1	a	a mechanism that operates like phonegapcordova would have to be implemented so that access to external hardware apis can be achieved
6859	1	a	a bonus would be to be able to set a link for all users incl net api preferred at least win api
6867	0	a	hope there are some automated tool for taking localised screenshots
6869	0	a	my thought using simulator while on a page a oneclick button that automatically take one screenshot for each language the app supports
6871	1	a	in the upload website a way to remove all screenshots and a way to upload all assets for all languages at once
6872	1	a	developers should be able to make custom lockscreen app
6878	1	a	it is very important that we support beta for both windows phone and windows
6881	1	a	allow users of paint to select parts of images on an image theyre drawing or editing diagonally other than only horizontallyvertically
6883	1	a	you could even make it possible to select the angle at which you select a certain part of the image manually and this would certainly make editing in paint a lot easier
6885	1	a	please provide the ability to the developer to change the color of the keyboard inside their app
6888	0	a	now this may not be so bad in english which has relatively short words but languages like german or danish make heavy use of compound words
6889	1	a	words can get very long and thus hyphenation is needed especially on small screens
6896	0	a	this would also bring feature parity with htmljs apps which already more
6897	1	a	api to detect incoming call and number so it can be blocked if not necessary and also can ring even in silent if it is important
6902	1	a	it would be great to have the option for creating publishers shared roaming folder as well
6904	1	a	open sideloading for everyone
6908	1	a	it would be better if this file was in json format and followed the manifest for web application standard from wc
6910	1	a	allow changing country and publisher name after registration on the store
6915	1	a	please either extend the existing class to consider the use cases for the phone or ditch it and come up with something more like apples approach which works better than whats currently there
6919	0	a	unfortunately this means the app is a nonestarter because the files can be several gigabytes in size so it kills the user experience everytime they try to open a file
6920	1	a	the emulator should support sensorsdk
6925	1	a	i propose you add a proper unit test suite for the winjs platform that can be automated and ideally run from common javascript tools like grunt
6934	1	a	please document how transitions work and expose the necessary api for us to create our own drop in replacements for the limited set of transitions supplied by the existing apis
6935	0	a	for example on wp if i want to use a custom transition i can fake the transition by using animations at the exit and entry to a page but in order for this to work i need to remove the existing stack of transitions from the frame because navigation will reuse the last transition from the frames collection
6938	1	a	at the very least we need a no op transition that can be used to prevent the frames stack from using the last transition to animate the page change
6959	1	a	this feature is to ask for xaml serialization featureset parity with wpfsystemxaml
6962	1	a	it could be better to have search box in windows phone application instead of having it in windows application alone
6964	0	a	auto focusing the input element in page ready is not working in windows mobile application
6966	1	a	as a developer i should have access to the entire winrt api if i am building an app for my own personal device
6970	1	a	perhaps more developers would build for windows if they can build their own tools for personal use without so many restrictions
6980	1	a	this is an excellent feature but i would love to see the same tools and support available for the shared project in a universal winjs app
6981	1	a	it would be great to use bower to install scripts once into the shared project rather than installing two copies of the same script into the windows project and the windows phone project
6982	1	a	it makes sense to disallow universal cxaml apps installing packages to the shared project because they might only target windows or only target windows phone
6984	0	a	therefore there should be no problem with installing scripts directly to the shared project using bower instead of installing two copies of the same script to two different projects
6992	1	a	it would make sense i think that en no region language will be used as a fallback for all en countries if there is no enregion specified
7003	1	a	please implement a permanent fix to the relevant backend systems
7004	1	a	also we need a supplementary fix to the issues faced by existing affected users without resorting them to contacting microsoft customer support to restore their purchase by way of adding credit to repurchase the app
7017	0	a	if you add more than a few like the performance is so bad that you have to wait for a few seconds after you stop to be sure that the pinscontrols are in the right position
7032	1	a	either use the identity version throughout the store and let us change that with the visual studio wizard or ensure that the dev center reads the package version rather than identity version
7036	0	a	visual studios create package wizard allows one to assign a version number however this assigns the package version number
7050	1	a	i would like some way so that i can have my various devices each with different form factor get the latest build deployed to them all or a select number of them instead of debugging simply failing
7086	1	a	pubcenter users should be able to decide how much they want to receive when they get a payment
7088	1	a	it would be great if i could decide to receive less money in a single payment and keep the rest for the next year
7089	1	a	expose an api that allows apps aside phone and messaging to trigger person reminders
7104	1	a	polish your new contact manager api to get the maximum performance hence the user not to sit idle till it loads
7107	0	a	it may be based on number only contacts contacts with email address or filtering only phone contacts other than any social contacts etc
7120	0	a	please consider my suggestion on this case
7130	1	a	please provide a simpler example with a clearer coding
7133	1	a	i think it is good to explain what is default image
7137	1	a	please provide support for adding developer user id to windows developer account
7139	1	a	hope that microsoft if possible allow us individuals to create individual developer account for free and allowed only to publish one app on windows phone or windows store
7157	1	a	please add a link to that links to the password change page at
7158	1	a	also add the same live profile password change link to the windows store profile
7160	1	a	might be nice to make it easier to find the right password change page
7161	1	a	allow background services to display controls on top of other applications
7162	1	a	it would be great to for example play a video in a small square box while browsing the web or respond to messages without having to open a message app
7163	1	a	please support mu live streamings
7164	1	a	please please please expand the email signature function so that you are able to include a detailed signature including embeded images
7166	1	a	by using the fileopenpicker class we can filter shown files by extensin but i think we should also be able to filter files by their name lets say i only want to show pictures whose name start with abcd or whose name ends with bcd
7169	0	a	so please provide this option
7173	1	a	the dev team should be able to access info through the dashboard
7192	1	a	make net available on all platformsincluding mac linux all smartphones
7207	1	a	microsoft could have created more tools for integrating nhibernate easily into net apps but they developed entityframework instead more
7208	1	a	just like in winrt could we have spell checking options and text prediction in window phone silverlight apps
7209	0	a	i was working on clipboard manager application for windows and discovered that there is no way to catch clipboardcontentchanged event when application is running in background seems the life cycle of winrt app doesnt allow this
7210	1	a	wish i would have a possibility to create a background task that is triggered by clipboard content changed system event
7212	1	a	add webp support so i can easily process and export images using the format
7214	1	a	we want access to every camera available at same tima
7224	1	a	i think there should be a property maybe something like showdeletebutton that allows you to specify whether the delete button is displayed
7226	0	a	ab testing is crucial for quantitative marketing
7235	1	a	id like to see the ability to reorder my related apps so i can choose which related apps get promoted first to users
7238	1	a	let the local apps install without need to access to windows phone store just like exe files in windows
7242	0	a	after profiling the app i found that after calling mediacapturecapturephototostoragefileasync method memory is not released and allocates mb with each call
7243	0	a	ive also voted for this suggestion as that could fix most of camera related issues on windows phone
7251	0	a	the only way to detect it is by looking for unauthorizedexception but that exception is ambiguous
7256	0	a	a location permission dialog may be showing when a network error occurs in an unrelated part of the code for example
7269	1	a	perhaps ensuring a year gap between signups would be enough of a deterrent to those that may want to maliciously close their account regularly
7274	1	a	please include my country yemen in pay out and advertisement too
7279	1	a	datepicker should be allowed to have a null value initially and not a programmatically set that could accidentally be mistake for a users input
7281	0	a	setting dayvisible to false prevents the spinner from showing which is nice but then the date is displayed when the value is shown in the field which sort of negates the feature
7288	1	a	it would be nice if an app could provide its own tasks todos to the os

7390	1	a	it would be nice to have one thing with three states rather than two things who have two states each
7402	0	a	developers need to write additional code using the deprecated directinput api to access those devices even though microsoft states that use of directinput should be avoided and xinput used instead for any gamepad functionality
7403	1	a	there should be an update to xinput api that will add functions so to migrate and simplify that functionality from directinput
7410	1	a	you should also be able to undelete an app package for hours after you delete

7550	1	a	it would be great if windows phone will support access to contacts groups

7578	0	a	i had unlucky case that my app was refused by the tester though on his screenshot you can see that he got exact message on why the app is not working as it required proper text to speech to be installed
7581	1	a	bring back support for ipxspx or at the very least provide compatible drivers either through the microsoft website or as a legacy feature that can be installed on windows
7588	0	a	currently need to generate a bitmap image which not works well for list etc

7672	1	a	please create properties for disable scrolling pan and zoom and auto ressizing the webview
7688	1	a	id like to see windows apis command prompts file explorer support a much longer file path
7695	1	a	i feel that it is important to be able to minimize the commandbar in windows phone apps because there is limited screenspace so even something like the commandbar can make a difference
7696	1	a	i like the ability for apps to connect to the people hub and show items in the news feed but there are some things that are really annoying to consumers and could be solved with a few apis
7699	1	a	i suggest some apis for the app to attach some actions or commands to the item that the user can invoke straight from the people hub
7708	0	a	it is cool that the facebook app can show my news feed in the people hub but its annoying the fact i have to go to the facebook app to do something
7709	1	a	i suggest some apis for the app to attach some actions or commands to the item that the user can invoke straight from the more
7710	1	a	we need a background task system event to update the wide tile and the lock screen message when the device wakes up the lock screen becomes visible on windows phone universal apps
7720	1	a	visual studio should allow builtin gpu programming for major brands nvidia amd and intel

7765	1	a	please extend this to be the maximum time that the bluetooth spec allows between pings to maintain a connection which is seconds or atleast make it greater than seconds so that very low power bluetooth devices can be made
7787	1	a	microsoft should include a good ui for the dashboard and to make some arrangement to display total downloads in the main pagelike that of google android dashboardthe windows developer dashboard is simply boring stuff
7788	1	a	id love to have better and improved reports to improve my app and tune the descriptions of my app store listings aso

7861	1	a	allow more specific queries on appointments
7863	1	a	platform should support new applications that are not big companies
7872	1	a	also id like the rating of the app to allow me as the developer to respond back to the end user ideally emailing them and or posting it online and allow them to correspond with me to try and resolve any issues whether that is with microsoft being a proxy or whatever makes sense
7890	1	a	i suggest to create another option that alternates lost of signal and bad signal
7891	1	a	create an infinite loop that breakes the connection in a random time
7893	1	a	a an ability to the emulator that can emulate a bad data connection so we can discover performance problems before our clients receive it
7896	1	a	well i think that the devcenter app should be updatedextended so that the app can show the windows store apps as well as the phone apps which it currently does ideally it should also use the live tiles to show the current stats on your apps
7924	1	a	suggestion show exactly that error message in the windows store dashboard
7926	1	a	a single line should go through all the months regardless of the release or at least we should be able to turn that filter on or off
7940	1	a	please send more information on app before removal of suspension
7942	1	a	i am asking whoever checks or tests it put more information of their findings rather than giving the developers generic policy numbers like or
7946	1	a	when utilizing the file picker and specifying one or more extensions the dialog that gets shown to the user should filter to these extensions not show everything but only have those items selectable
7963	1	a	let people inherit from easingfunctionbase because microsoft you do not have infinite wisdom and the predefined list of easing functions you give everyone doesnt have the one i need
7977	1	a	please expand your search range to at least the top apps
7980	1	a	please update the windows sdk and windows app certification kit to allow us to use win prefetchvirtualmemory function
7987	1	a	i think that having and iap price point of could be wildly attractive to end users and get more purchases for developers
7989	1	a	id like to be able to ping for nearby devices running an app using peerffinder but while the app is not in the foreground
7991	1	a	would it be practical to make it so that a user could authorize proximity tracking in the background so that an app could utilize it
7993	1	a	make possible to add a range of listmapicon to make it faster and optimized
7994	1	a	provide computer vision apis that would allow developers to get access to functions such as motion tracking facialgesturevoice recognition egomotion structures from motion and object identification etc
7995	1	a	pivot and panorama controls should have options to enabledisable wrapping
7996	1	a	also the scroll viewer should have options to disable overscrolling effect
8000	1	a	please cant we have an option in the wpappmanifest file to untick fast resume and allow wp apps to not run in fast resume mode just like in wp
8005	1	a	microsoft should provide a better beta program for developers and user like the one in android in which you dont have to download a separate app you update the stable one to the beta in the store
8012	1	a	allowing to prefetch an ad allow the developer to optimise his ad strategy
8017	1	a	it will be useful if we can set the reminder tone to vibrate so that not every reminder would beep when youre in a meeting
8018	1	a	at times you may want to set a reminder and let it vibrate in your pocket still giving only you a notification instead of beeping out loud when you dont want it to
8029	1	a	for one of our products we need to support nfc card readingwriting with existing devices and several types of cards mifare ul ulc calypso desfire maybe even more
8037	1	a	vs could create those folders in each project and bring in the classes pages and user controls from the original project
8050	1	a	please add recent places to suggestedstartlocation in fileopenpicker api
8052	1	a	it would be much less frustrating for windowswindows phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of windows windows phone
8074	1	a	please implement the httplistener class so that we can run rest based controls similar to xbox smartglass for our own apps
8110	1	a	let normal uris to be able to send notifications to the app using the windowexternalnotify and not only the uris
8111	1	a	give the power to the developer to decide if a page is allowed to use the scriptnotify event or not
8118	1	a	and my only wish is to format a datetime like the user wants to see it
8143	1	a	please give us ability to run background agent and collect name of the current application in foreground
8152	1	a	could you please add programmiatic printing to the winrt api
8154	0	a	under wpf it is possible to initiate printing to the default printer by simply calling print on a properly configured printdocument object
8157	0	a	in order to print the guests must leave the tailored kiosk experience and interact with the local print dialog
8162	1	a	while this is possible with compositionsurface i feel it is needed on the image control as well
8168	1	a	the lockscreen text attribute should be separated out from tile attributes
8171	1	a	could you please have a report that includes the prices before the final payment
8174	1	a	we need more control over the device so childrens activities can be regulated
8178	0	a	once your app activates this mode users will not be able to see notifications access other apps or return to the home screen until your app exits the mode
8194	1	a	make necessary conditions so that developers choose proper representing application high quality images as application symbols in store matching modern ui
8199	1	a	it would be good if we can at least optionally reduce the speed of the emulator to better reproduce real world devices
8220	0	a	technically everything went smoothly but when i tried to submit the update it required that i reserved a name
8228	1	a	please provide access to calendar api to customize the day styles basing upon requirement
8237	1	a	id like a way to access the deviceextendedproperties specifically the anid in a windows store app
8244	0	a	everything is fine up until that point but if you want to serialize that class so that you can store it and load it directly instead of traversing the filesystem and opening up each file to read its id tags every time you open the app which can be a lot of unnecessary work especially for larger libraries or so you can send which book to play to an audio background task you really dont have many options
8249	1	a	my proposal is an api out of storagefolder to retrieve a storageitem given a relative path from that storagefolder
8298	1	a	my suggestion is that when a payment is being processed this should be indicated on the financial report which include the expected date it will arrive and the exact amount being processed
8299	1	a	i would suggest you look into admobadsense reporting for inspiration as its very convenience and everything a developer want to know about payments is easily accessible
8306	1	a	it would be nice to have such an api in winrt so we dont have to resort to native directx each time we need something more than a couple of shapes
8338	1	a	what i want is the ability to record those alongside systemprovided etw events so that i can see how my codes activity fits in with system behaviour
8343	1	a	i would like to have better access to lockscreen so that i can completely customize it which includes how the time is displayed any custom content like photos or news wallpaper
8344	1	a	it should also allow a timer based updation
8349	1	a	obviously there should probably be a pin requirement for first useset up trust but the nfc capabilities of the wp platform will never be fully realized until a simple tap can make something happen without user interference
8352	0	a	i think this is a bug because i think if the writeablebitmap decides to update the pixelwidth and pixelheight property it should also update the pixelbuffer or the data is inconsistent
8358	1	a	make multitasking a real thing like seeing a video or having a mini calc when browse some thing
8362	1	a	live tiles are fine but we need a true way to make tiles more dynamic and that would be accomplished with a widget application template
8363	1	a	in a similar way to the new lockscreen apps allow developers to create an app that runs inside a tile of larger dimensions that then current predefined tile sizes
8364	1	a	the app should have full access to touch events on the tile so it can respond to them
8374	1	a	allow apps to act as data sources for other apps
8375	1	a	build on wcf to allow onphone apptoapp communication
8378	1	a	allow json andor xml to pass data between apps
8381	1	a	make apps request permission the first time they talk to a new app then let it happen in the background
8385	1	a	we need io brokers to enable copy and paste scenarios in universal app in phone and tablet
8387	1	a	we need real background download broker so we can have torrent or custom download scenarios some of them may not apply to specific form factor
8395	1	a	we need windows phone to synchronize its clock via the internet
8397	1	a	include an api to add remove deactivate tracking protection lists tpl to further drive down data usage enable selective protection against rogue sites tracking and just having a sense of control
8406	1	a	it is better if developers can start their app from background i mean one develops an app that has permission to start itself when it receives a notification
8413	1	a	i understand power consumption is a consideration but a more balanced middle ground like only allowing more intensive background tasks when the system is plugged in andor giving users clear indications such activity is occurring liek android does in its notification bar so that they know why battery life is being impacted would make the winrt environment much more useful and in turn drive adoption
8426	1	a	it would be great for a permanently running app to have an api which notifies it when an update is available to notify when an update is forced to permit the app to check for an update easily and also to permit the app execute the update
8438	1	a	would become even more useful if say i could share to reading list from chrome extension or mac desktop or ios
8439	1	a	we need the pivotviewer control for wpf and winrt please
8441	1	a	i think that a wise addition would be to create a universal search platform that when enabled a single tap on the search button will bring up only a search bar and with that the user would search for content inside the app and by content i am talking specifically for app content
8443	0	a	if i use this xaml definition it work but the groupheader is not wide as the listview
8481	0	a	with maxnumberofcolums you can limit the number of columns
8489	0	a	win applications need to be more productive for businesses
8490	1	a	allow xaml winrt apps to change the lock screen background
8492	1	a	it would be much more comfortable to be able to read the entire notification in the center of notifications for wp
8504	1	a	be responsible and give more specific details why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things
8515	1	a	as with css it would be very useful if we could set text based framework elements to be uppercase lowercase title case etc with a texttransform property in xaml
8532	1	a	please remove that validation or validate according with my tax plan and not my country in the account
8556	1	a	the point is to make the app universal across devices so that our engineers do not have to spend too much time learning and relearning the controls
8562	1	a	please allow windows phone filefolder picker to have access to onedrive and store the location in futureaccesslist
8563	1	a	also please allow onedrive folder to be stored locally like winrt
8568	1	a	because of windows and windows phone universal app i am hoping to adapt the app to windows phone as well
8570	1	a	make sd boot fresh each time phone is restarted or double files with nothing in them to play then error
8578	1	a	prompt all users with a warning that they should make sure that the vpn is disabled before proceeding including most users who have not enabled a vpn in the first place and popping such a message almost every time the app is launched
8580	1	a	rewrite large portions of code as native code and use the winsock apis instead of the winrt
8593	1	a	make bing vision lens in the camera app pinnable to start for quick access again andor add it to the cortana screen to the left of the music search button perhaps
8595	1	a	please add the from to options right after download new email under each email account to specify when the phone is allowed to check emails
8600	1	a	the online media extensibility is fantastic however it would be better if you allowed more sorting abilities for albums pictures and videos
8604	1	a	it would be good if there was more sorting either via the photo hub or via code which allows all items to be sorted titlecreation timestamplast updated timestamp ascendingdescending
8606	1	a	pleas allow in the wmappmanifest a selection box to force legacy resume mode so my wp app can function just as it did in wp
8611	1	a	however there should be more of swipe gestures than the tap methods
8612	1	a	to set a difference a swipe to the right should launch settings menu as a swipe to the left launches the apps list
8613	1	a	plesae implement windowsapplicationmodelsuspendingdeferral as idisposable probably already declared in isuspendingdeferral and call method complete from within idisposabledispose to simplify its usage
8614	1	a	hey i thought it would be really useful if users could add a homepage to their internet explorer for their wp like they would on a desktoppc
8617	1	a	im apps could have custom keyboards or more fun ways of inputting data could be used
8627	1	a	for security reasons id really like to see an option that if the high quality backup via wifi is enabled and if the phone is not currently connected to wifi then the phone automatically creates resized smaller photo and uploads it via data to the cloud and then deletes the resized photo from the phone
8642	0	a	when you connect an iphone to a mac you can view the webview from safari by going to developdebug
8648	1	a	with frameworks like angular node jquery etc becoming more popular we really need means to debug our apps to provide the best web experience
8655	1	a	i would like to be able to pull in bing news search results for a specified keyword
8657	0	a	android has thirdparty apps that can block your appsgames with a password
8662	1	a	i would like to get short videos in fullscreen instead of picture on lockscreen
8665	1	a	i hope you like the idea i bet many people would like to have spinning earthwind blowingriver streamingwaterfallsetc on their lockscreen
8681	0	a	therefore if you want to detect horizontal swipe manipulations in a vertical scrolling scrollviewer for a custom listview item horizontal sliding animation implementation for example it simply cannot be done
8695	1	a	in my opinion it is essential to have true multitouch support for standard controls at least in universal applications
8712	1	a	please extend song class with more useful properties such as lastplayeddate addeddate
8721	1	a	but why not allow it to be used locally by sideloading or through the emulators
8731	1	a	it would be great if you would add a remoteid to the calendars
8748	1	a	i think there should be a casual genre section as a lot of apps dont fall into any specific section already listed
8750	0	a	for example timer and alarm apps
8755	1	a	it would be nice if more recent reviews would have more weight in the total score of the app
8760	1	a	please make bookmarks for podcasts persistent after moving to another podcast and coming back
8762	1	a	it would be nice to be able to render xaml that is not on the visual tree and perhaps in a background task
8771	1	a	we should be able to use descriptive text overlays in our screenshots it allows us to better point out what the screenshot is showing
8773	0	a	for some reason entering a number with a at the front in to the dialler task in an app in wp wp or wp results in the message please enter service codes directly from the phones keypad
8778	1	a	it would be helpful to be able to launch the calendar for a specific day ie i tell the user you have x appointments today would you like to review them
8794	1	a	it would be cool to allow the applicationbar to have more icons available
8796	1	a	it would be also cool to allow for more than one application bar per page so you could specify one at the top left bottom or right
8807	1	a	when will the alarm feature be implemented in winrt to support the phone
8808	1	a	it would be greater if we could disable the close function while doing important tasks like writing to the storage or similar
8818	1	a	please enable removing language code from the dev center language history
8830	1	a	it should be an option to remove the ru language code from my app language history or an option to completly replace fully replace the prevoiuses xaps
8865	0	a	getting the geolocator to actually do something requires getting the magical and undocumented setting of properties correct and then attaching event handlers
8885	1	a	it would be extremely helpful if the reminderalarm api supported creating a reminder for specific days of the week
8887	1	a	the trial feature should be builtin with automatic enforcement user prompting disabling etc just as it is in the windows store
8891	0	a	contrast this with the windows phone world where the developer indicates trial mode in the store but has to manually track the number of days since install whether the user has purchased etc
8902	1	a	when submitting an app the store submission process should prompt you to link to documentation for any uri schemes your app includes in the manifest file or mark them as private uris if you dont want to document them
8904	1	a	currently the best place to find documentation for uri schemes is the nokia dev wiki but this information should really be available though microsoft
8909	0	a	above could save hours spent on reading wrong answers
8929	1	a	there need to be a business app settings launcher native in the api
8931	1	a	there must be a way to handle this kind of problem like statistics on how many times an app was started or not being able to start applications other than some basic apps
8935	0	a	currently as of when there is an embedded video in a webview and the user presses the fullscreen button the video expands to only the extents of the webview which isnt fullscreen if the webview is surrounded by other controls
8936	1	a	there should be a property on the webview that controls the fullscreen behavior such that it is possible to fill the entire viewable area of the display with the video and its controls
8937	1	a	have an api for an application to interact with and listen for incomming connections from paired bluetooth devices while in background
8946	1	a	it will be very useful if user can scan custom qr code from other screen or poster from phone search vision function and launch app via associated uri saved in qr code
8953	1	a	an httpbased api with a programfriendly logon exampleoauth would be most welcome
8955	0	a	there is no good reason for not allowing this so please add it
8961	0	a	everyone in the usa has nice upload speeds possibly but not worldwide and i presume microsoft would wish to enable developers from other countries also to be able to use their dev center
8962	1	a	just remove the timeouts completely or at least increase all timeouts by a factor of at least its not a big deal to implement
8971	1	a	to go step further making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support system
8972	1	a	set up a brokerage system whereby the developer never sees the users live email address and instead replies to a proxy email set up peruser
8995	1	a	trial feature should be builtin with autoprompted and disabling just like the windows store
9011	1	a	is it possible to create a traffic counter that can show how many traffic i have by wifi or by gms lte
9014	1	a	the reminder function in the wp calendar must be expand to more weekly options
9033	1	a	similarly this idea could be thought through for integration of one note with other native applications like camera messaging etc
9035	1	a	it would be very useful to be able to prepair a mmscomposetask in the same way that we today could use the smscomposetask
9048	0	a	we would like to create an app to monitor the time users spend in other the apps enabling enterprise customers to optimize a users day by analyzing time on applications
9055	1	a	i would like to have an option for each skydrive folder to make them available offline
9057	0	a	so those folders could be downloaded completely to the phone when a wifi is available to access them offline later
9075	1	a	windows should allow additional user accounts added to track review the application review process similar to what apple and android apple stores allow
9078	1	a	please to have competitive advantage i would like you to provide an expedite package for app certification for developers who wants their apps to be published fast
9092	1	a	having users enroll their phone using the same mdm client no matter the vendor is a nice idea
9095	1	a	can we have an api to enroll the device through an app or allow mdm enrollment to initiate through a browser download
9096	1	a	as a developer i would like to have method to defer app deactivationsuspending in order to call async methods easily
9101	1	a	if you are concerned about security reasons a good implementation of this api would be to always notify the user that a message from that application has been sent and where it was sent
9112	0	a	we now need to add extra code to reposition it at the top after it has been loaded
9120	1	a	id suggest to include all transactions in the report
9123	1	a	all uesr want to find fast their contact when they must call so its very good to insert the fast search on phone dialer its good that the user can choose the better method to search like name orand surname orand address etc
9124	0	a	i think its good that th apps can access to the list of installed apps and can decide to unistall or freeze or lock etc
9125	1	a	allow downloading of submissioned xap files in windows phone application publish submission process
9127	1	a	please make kids corner as a another account
9130	1	a	atleast remove password for kidscorner or make another password for kidscorner
9131	1	a	allow debit cards as a payment instrument for registration and renewals
9143	1	a	would be great to discover service hosts in local networks
9148	1	a	provide an automation toolkit to enable developers to walk through a series of steps and take screenshots at relevant points then rerun those steps in different languages to automate the process of taking screenshots in different languages for app submission
9149	1	a	would also be helpful in its own right for general localization testing to verify that localized strings have messed up layout
9150	0	a	as a developer the only way to increase app ratings and review is to prompt user
9157	1	a	i was expecting some notification center on the site so that i can see what new things have happened over my account since my last visit
9159	1	a	let me be able to see the reviews that are added or app crashes so that my attention towards them grows infinitely large
9162	1	a	i want in wp back it stiill works in wp that i can set a color for applicationbar icons
9186	1	a	isnt it better to allow developers to change their app name inside app store according to different language and culture
9223	0	a	this would be very useful in the resource constrained environment of a phone
9225	1	a	allow more code to be shared across platforms and
9233	1	a	i would also be nice to be able to retain some kind of unique key the app could store or some other way the app can have a way to query todo items that the app created
9236	1	a	a shared key chain to share data between the apps this help in apps with features like sso
9237	1	a	include support for pen input like on the surface pro and surface pro for both wp and rt
9239	1	a	make it possible to optionally declare a function onclick for live tiles such that this code is executed when the live tiles is presed without leaving the home screen
9244	1	a	allow the phone to be used as a mini presentation device
9245	0	a	this can allow the phone to be used as a secondary display or project the screen contents on for example pushtv devices or widi receivers
9271	1	a	please make it possible to build wp apps
9279	1	a	the app should have more advanced options for scheduling when and how often it will run in the background perhaps by setting a different interval for different days of the week or times of the day or by specifying the time until it will run again each time it runs
9280	1	a	users should be given insight into how often an application is running in the background so they can decide which applications are worth allowing to process in the background and which arent
9282	1	a	furthermore the second duration should be expanded to at least seconds to account for larger data transfers and slower network connections
9293	0	a	this is also a capability that other mobile platforms have and i think it is needed to build quality apps with a good user experience
9296	1	a	apps should get at least seconds of background processing time to complete such network transfers and process the response
9308	0	a	in my opinion chinese app are mainly design for chinese and handsets are mostly from china market its may be challenging for developers to get phones from different countries or regions
9310	1	a	having said these i propose such feature of prompting to do a language pack installation to be on the windows phone os level when user switches language
9312	1	a	having said these i thought a feature for prompting user installing language pack done on phone os level would be good
9318	1	a	provide access to playlist api to be able to create auto playlists based on the song library on the phone
9320	1	a	if we use diferent datatemplates why not make every panel virtualizable
9327	1	a	for example i would love it if my gps app could turn location on when the app starts and turn it back off when the app exits
9336	1	a	an developer should have an option or tool to manage that list and select which ones are displayed
9348	1	a	under this suggestion the developer should be unable to manage or modify the basestandard images this suggestion is only for adding additional images
9349	1	a	the windows phone emulator should include the ability to manage vm snapshots for windows phone images
9352	0	a	if you want to load content after you reach the end of a list you have to write your own user control or create data bindings
9354	1	a	if navigationservicenavigate would let us pass a parameter of type object along with the uri it will help us to keep less states objects in the app class which will become a mess as project grows
9358	1	a	please provide a photocroptask that takes an imagebyte and provides the same crop tool
9359	1	a	include a pixelheight and pixelwidth as optional parameters so an aspect ratio can be included
9360	0	a	this would allow for picture cropping
9363	1	a	provide an apis that allow apps to either control settings eg being able to toggle wifi when nfc tag is interacted
9364	1	a	also it would be nice if there was an api that allowed an app to be integrated into the settings applets instead of a standard app
9374	1	a	id like to see the windows app store be similar to google where i can skip the hassle and headache of certification and just get an app on the store in hours not days
9384	1	a	allow us developers to renew our expired subscriptions
9386	0	a	ive asked the support they said me that i have to create another subscription with another live account and after it ask them to migrate apps and related data
9398	0	a	its not healthy to keep several accounts that means nothing specially ones that you just had to create because you need to renew the subscription
9413	1	a	please provide any idea about background service in wm as gps tracking automatically
9416	0	a	if windows phone as any faith in its future it needs a lot more support from the development team
9424	1	a	if you want people to develop apps you need to offer a dev platform that doesnt only run on the latest and greatest machines
9426	1	a	we miss a control like the integrated photo viewer to show photos or any controls page by page by using flick gestures
9437	1	a	it should be an option to remove the ru language code from my app language history
9440	0	a	you can publish an update with the removed ru language but this update will not fully replace the old version and you will in truble
9473	1	a	i think placement should be splitted in horizontalplacement left center right and verticalplacement top bottom to have more flexibility
9481	1	a	i would like to have a reminder system api that allows me to know if the phone is near a phone from a friend location based
9482	0	a	example remind me to ask holly about the project status when i meet her the next time
9489	0	a	i think this will be the wrong way
9492	0	a	i am a professional software engineer and i am developing with visual studio at work so i thougt its a goot idea to buy a windows phone because i could develop some phone applications
9497	1	a	it would be very convenient to just click a button and have your app placed in only the markets that we do not need to worry about taxes
9518	0	a	since changing is not an option you will need to create a new account within the turkey region
9522	0	a	since you have mentioned that you are a student account this might require you to create to simultaneous accounts
9525	0	a	note that if you have a store account the apps from that side will not transfer
9537	1	a	it would be great if there were specific classes that could be instantiated on nonui threads and then loaded by uithread image objects
9542	0	a	this would be very useful in determining why sometimes upload is slow
9543	1	a	mark sideloaded apps in app list so one can differentiate an instore app from a side loaded version thats in development
9546	0	a	like surface pro implementing the pressure layer pen on wp and win rt
1567	0	a	convert exe to appx by command lines
1571	0	a	its century
1572	0	a	i know that text boxes can be customized easily
1573	0	a	but the uwp textboxes are not that god when it comes to numeric input
1574	0	a	im currently working on a software that has a lot of numeric input
1578	0	a	only allows numeric input
1587	0	a	format numbers with commas on thousands ie
1591	0	a	if the user enters a value less than the min value the value will be updated to min value on lost focus
1610	0	a	notice that intellisense suggests test for the bind path
1613	0	a	the same with old stlye binding works fine
1614	0	a	comparison results with edge on the right
1618	0	a	app tested is webview release
1619	0	a	tried both webviewexecutionmodeseparatethread
1621	0	a	even rendering on separate thread will block ui thread for example reveal highlight effect while bigger page is loading or typing into textbox will lag while javascript in the page is running
1623	0	a	currently it is impossible to implement context menus save files and implement other functions general web browsers have
1627	0	a	every modern operating system on this planet uses lf style line endings except for windows which still writes one more useless byte at every end of a line
1628	0	a	it is time for a change
1648	0	a	what can i do
1649	0	a	my windows is version build
1664	0	a	something in both silverlight and wpf but missing from uwp tiled brushes
1665	0	a	although curiously tilebrush is still the base class for brushes just without tiling
1666	0	a	this will allow use of tiled images and perhaps videos for use as brushes anywhere a xaml brush is accepted like backgrounds text foregrounds path fills etc
1667	0	a	i want my uwp ui to look the same across any screen of the same resolution regardless of the scale factor applied by windows
1668	0	a	for instance when running my app on the hololens it applies a scale factor
1669	0	a	this means the ui looks squished when compare to a desktop screen of a similar resolution x
1671	0	a	can this be implemented for the hololens
1674	0	a	there are situations where you might want to interrupt navigating away from a page when using navigationview
1675	0	a	say you throw up a message box a la do you want to save the changes yesnocancel if you were to click cancel theres no way to prevent the navigationview to follow through with it visually
1676	0	a	say you have two menu items one home and the other whatever
1678	0	a	theres no sane way to do it eg
1679	0	a	a cancel boolean on the event args of the iteminvoked event
1680	0	a	an example for this would be this budgeting app i am currently working on
1681	0	a	if youre editing a transaction but havent committed it trying to navigate away id like to throw up a save changes
1682	0	a	message box with the typical yesnocancel options
1683	0	a	i cant deal with the cancel action without code voodoo trying to revert the selecteditem asap
1684	0	a	thanks for considering changing this
1690	0	a	in my opinion uwp is too much app centric
1691	0	a	we are spending and loosing a great amount of time working around trying to do simple things like pass command line arguments write on folders trying to execute another program
1694	0	a	os information is not included at all on the usage page
1695	0	a	while i get crashes by os health page i need to crossreference this with usage by os to determine the overall impact of a given bug
1698	0	a	we are currently developing for desktoponly screens we have control over the device types and want to prevent users from sizing the window smaller than px x px
1699	0	a	this application is far too complex for mobile screens and x is too small
1700	0	a	is this an option we can hope for in the near future
1702	0	a	the default menuflyoutsubitem allows you to add subitems either through xaml or the items code behind property
1704	0	a	im currently trying to convert an application that contains some of the coreutils utilities most notably exe and exe
1705	0	a	this fails abruptly at preparing virtual file system
1707	0	a	verbose begin convertfiles
1708	0	a	verbose renaming files directory to vfs
1709	0	a	verbose getting all files under cvfs
1710	0	a	verbose processing virtual file system entries
1711	0	a	verbose an error occurred converting your application
1712	0	a	here is the full error record
1714	0	a	powershell error record
1715	0	a	the specified wildcard character pattern is not valid exe
1716	0	a	powershell stack trace
1725	0	a	systemmanagementautomationwildcardpatternexception the specified wildcard character pattern is at systemmanagementautomationwildcardpatternismatchstring input
1784	0	a	looking at the vfsopsps file it seems that the testpath on line assumes that the file path is a standard wildcard not a file name
1785	0	a	looks like it could be fixed by adding managementautomationwildcardpatternescape somewhere but i havent been able to find out how to make the catalog writeable so that i can test this
1789	0	a	when running through c code analysis projects using atl will minimally hit the following atlcomh warnings
1791	0	a	buffer overrun while writing to mpdacl the writable size is pdaclaclsize bytes but bytes might be written
1795	0	a	buffer overrun while writing to newacl the writable size is aclsize bytes but bytes might be written
1798	0	a	orbit view currently have d plane so for mixed reality apps third dimension needed to expand it functionality
1799	0	a	like for example for space apps where earth have satellites neo and space stations and they all have orbits based on earth so orbital view in d make it better in mixed reality
1804	0	a	is there some sort of bug tracker for microsoft software
1805	0	a	kinda like uservoice but for bug reports
1806	0	a	i have an app that works normally but when launched via the desktop bridge theres some strange issues with com
1807	0	a	what does the desktop bridge do differently
1810	0	a	coreapplication now has a requestrestartasync method but it fails in a desktop bridge app with notinforeground
1813	0	a	i wonder if this is because of the way the desktop bridge technology wraps the wpf application
1814	0	a	any ideas on how i can cause the app to restart
1816	0	a	however collapsing a pivot item does not remove it from the ui visual tree
1817	0	a	the header still exists and is keyboard focusable
1818	0	a	since you can correctly hide listboxitems i am considering this a bug
1820	0	a	repeatedly calling mediaplayerstepforwardoneframe mediaplayerstepbackoneframe should switch between two frames but video is moving slightly back
1821	0	a	repository on github
1823	0	a	at first this isnt an issue since the control isnt visible
1824	0	a	however if you make the parent visible binding will not be triggered and you must manually force an update to get bound values to appear
1825	0	a	this was probably done as a performance optimization however binding needs to recognize visibility changes if it wont bind when an item is not visible in the ui
1826	0	a	otherwise yet again mvvm is broken
1827	0	a	i have a uwp usercontrol line chart that renders a pathfigure to a canvas
1828	0	a	this chart supports zooming and the pathfigure size is changed during zoom but clipped within the visible chart area
1829	0	a	at high zoom levels above the entire uwp app will crash with a native exception an unhandled win exception occured in app
1831	0	a	there must be a bug some place in the framework
1832	0	a	this crash only happens using the fall creators update after the clipping issue was fixed
1833	0	a	im guessing its a numerical overflow somewhere deep in the graphics stack
1837	0	a	from my viewpoint i think there is no way in managed code i should be getting a native exception like this
1840	0	a	the following hyperv networking configuration breaks dns name resolution on the virtual machine
1842	0	a	connecting the host to a noncorporate remote wifi network
1847	0	a	when a vm is connected to the default switch and the host is connected to the corporate network via cisco anyconnect the vm looses the ability to resolve dns addresses
1848	0	a	the vm is able to ping both public addresses and corporate addresses however it is unable to resolve names on either the public internet or corporate network
1849	0	a	this issue was submitted as a ms premier support ticket and a connect bug
1850	0	a	was advised by premier that this is an architectural issue
1857	0	a	start a vm and connect it to the default switch nat
1862	0	a	using the fall creators update version of uwp it seems that when a data context is changed to a new view model the previous view model is updated with null values
1863	0	a	this is the same as if the datacontext is set to null before changing view models
1864	0	a	it doesnt make sense why the bound values are updated when the datacontext is changed
1867	0	a	in stack overflow or any other forums we have option to add multiple tags related to our question
1868	0	a	currently is not possibile to create a new calendar inside an enterprise exchange user account
1869	0	a	its only allowed to create an app calendar which lives on local device
1871	0	a	the windowsservicesstore namespace does not provide a class that you can use to simulate license info during testing
1874	0	a	at the moment a vsto addin cannot be published on windows store or on office store
1875	1	a	an idea could be extending desktop app converter tool in order to manage vsto addin
1877	0	a	i reported that since studio the designer crash due to attached properties
1881	0	a	changing to last uwp solve the designer problem but the attached properties are not working the binding and i have to do set binding by code
1888	0	a	while understandable that there are big challenges to overcome to make this possible but currently the bar to create optional packages is too high due that the time investment and issues that can occur makes it not that worh it due the c requirement
1892	0	a	the createstreamedfileasync method is there since windows to delay creation of file data
1893	0	a	however when using the result in a dragdrop or clipboard operation windows explorer errors out with x no such interface supported
1894	0	a	it can be used between uwp apps but not in windows explorer which really is a shame
1895	0	a	there are desktop win apis for delay creation of files that are used heavily eg
1896	0	a	in winzip and similar applications to delay actual unzip of files until really required but they cannot be used in uwp
1897	1	a	please support the uwp equivalent called createstreamedfileasync in windows explorer
1899	0	a	things like minconnectioninterval maxconnectioninterval slavelatency and connection supervisory timeout
1901	0	a	it is a compendium of various pdf viewer tutorials rolled into a single user control
1902	0	a	i have no doubt it could be improved by community involvement
1905	0	a	the documentation may be found here
1909	0	a	an given example of the api can be seen below
1919	0	a	under uwp it is still not possible to open a folder or file out of the sandbox
1920	0	a	even to suggest a path is not possible
1921	0	a	so your are not able to suggest a folder or file to the user by a pathstring
1922	0	a	so at the moment i have to tell my customers open the folderpicker and navigate from the pictureslibrary to the pathdvery long pathfinalfolder
1923	0	a	and thereby the folderpicker has no preview to the content in a folder
1925	0	a	actual implementing an selection of file or folder in uwp how easy but stupid
1932	0	a	so pickersuggestedstartlocation is not a string to a path but only a selection of libraries
1933	0	a	does microsoft really believe that users and developers accept that lowest budget setup
1934	0	a	now after the great windows fall creators update it is still a joke to switch and develop to uwp
1936	0	a	does anybody at ms have an idea how to propose an path in an uwp application
1943	0	a	well currently i have a uwp app that needs to call a webapi service that is secured with azure ad
1944	0	a	i have been looking for samples and tutorials to do this and i have found some
1945	0	a	but they all differ in what to do exactly
1955	0	a	i have created apppinmanager helper class just call those helper fuunction it will takecare to add into the startmenu or taskbar
1959	0	a	for example a long running task where the user is not allowed to back out until it completes
1961	1	a	currently uwp community toolkit includes seven services that are very useful but more is always better it would be awesome to add more and more services including a big one for a lot of people wordpress
1964	0	a	to clarify that this can be done from windows as a part of windows administration and configuration for instance via group policies powershell windows updates schedule tasks etc
1972	0	a	there are several issues with the file activation neighboringfilesquery argument and the file system indexer
1974	0	a	if files are loaded using the neighboringfilesquery then getpropertiesasync on those files will only return properties that have been indexed
1975	0	a	this prevents reading things like altitude from the gps location data
1977	0	a	the above is made a lot worse on computers where indexing file content is disabled right click on the drive in explorer select properties and see check box at the bottom which used to be recommended for ssd drives
1978	0	a	in particular no imageproperties are available in this case
1979	0	a	it also happens if the indexer isnt working properly which is not uncommon
1981	0	a	if the indexer is really broken for some reason this started happening on my computer so is not uncommon then it will fail to pick up any neighboring files at all confirmed by using the default photos app to open a photo in a folder with lots of photos and it only showed one photo
1984	0	a	i dont think this is a security issue because the data is in the file and the file contents are readable
1997	0	a	this will enable automatic testing on hybrid windows apps where dom inspection is necessary
1998	0	a	when setting tooltipserviceplacement to mouse the text in the tooltip is no longer sharp
1999	0	a	it looks like the tooltip is not perfectly aligned to the device pixels but rather half a pixel off vertically
2000	0	a	this is on windows fall creators update build dpi scale the app targets windows sdk
2003	0	a	would be a lot more intuitive useful and less distractive then the current overlay
2006	0	a	the way ink input is currently handled is sooo win i know there is inkcanvas and windowsuiinputinkinganalysis put this should be build into the text controls in a standard way
2009	1	a	imagine writing text directly into the textbox or richeditbox canvas without the inkkeyboardoverlay
2015	0	a	it limits the use case of masterview
2016	0	a	we cant use pivot semantic zoom gridview pulltorefresh slidablelistitem and more
2018	0	a	dont fake the page navigation using storyboard
2019	0	a	then devs can use connected animations
2020	0	a	i upgraded to the latest vs and change my uwp app to use netnative
2021	0	a	it now gets a number of linker problems that are being caused by microsoft components
2025	0	a	calling this method would throw exception at runtime
2027	1	a	if for some reason your pinvoke does not satisfy those requirements please use dllimportexactspellingtrue to indicate that you understand the implications of using nonuwp apis
2029	0	a	i dont call this function
2030	0	a	when i traced down some new crashes i found that socketconnectasync is trying to call this function and failing because it doesnt exist
2031	0	a	i have about similar errors in the build that are referencing things i dont directly call
2032	0	a	ive reverted to netnative until this gets fixed
2044	0	a	in windows forms toolkit there is a handy control called the numericupdowncontrol
2062	1	a	current appextension only supports loading assets and scripts
2063	1	a	in many scenarios rd party author may provide some code actable with the main app for example decoding another file format
2064	0	a	there may be trusting problems
2065	0	a	if you change the datapackageoperation to copy the problem goes away
2067	0	a	we are experiencing an issue where the presence of a passwordbox with a numericpin inputscope overrides the inputscope of other controls on the pageuntil the passwordbox has received focus
2068	0	a	on a touch screen this manifests every time a user reaches the first page in our uwp app that has a numericpinscoped passwordbox
2072	0	a	build and run the app
2074	0	a	see that the touch keyboard is the numericpin keyboard even though the focused textbox should have the default inputscope
2075	0	a	click into textbox
2078	0	a	keyboard remains numericpin
2080	0	a	see that the inputscopes of the textboxes are now honored
2094	0	a	add the xaml below to mainpagexaml
2096	0	a	before doing anything else click the show touch keyboard button in the notification tray such that the touch keyboard appears
2098	0	a	i think i found a problem in media player
2099	0	a	the problem happens on phone if media player is paused from another media app
2100	0	a	in this case will be fired only mediaplayerplaybacksessionplaybackstatechanged event and it is not possible to detect whether app was paused through user or system
2101	0	a	but if phone calls then will be simulated systemmediatransportcontrols pause button click mediaplayersystemmediatransportcontrolsbuttonpressed event and on phone call i can correctly stop my player and change some states
2106	0	a	i am preloading images for speed and i need to release the memory immediately when no longer needed to prevent memory failures but setting the reference to null and even calling gccollect immediately does not always result in an immediate release of memory
2107	0	a	ive looked into using a softwarebitmapsource instead but this is a lot slower and uses more memory and i am not sure whether its dispose method works doesnt affect memory shown in vs debugger but did seem to have an effect when testing using a mobile emulator
2111	0	a	compact overlay window is always shown at the righttop corner
2114	0	a	conditional check doesnt actually solve the problem it doesnt suit the control like navigationview since at the end developer still have to create a navigationview with splitview which is really pain to maintain
2117	0	a	more details can be found in this issue
2119	0	a	we can see the support of communities in uwpcommunitytoolkit
2121	0	a	as a selflearner it is very hard to find a tutorial to learn new things
2122	0	a	mapcontrol has some nice extensibility options but requires specifying a token even if youre using local or custom tile sources as the background replacement layer
2124	0	a	i hear a lot about clean uninstall but we noticed a few months ago appx leaves some stuff behind
2125	0	a	specifically persisted appframe window sizing data remains behind potentially leaving the userdev in a potential bad or confusing window state
2126	0	a	see the data piling up in the following stores
2130	0	a	a lot of small time developers like myself dont have the means to use the microsoft store to host their apps
2131	0	a	i develop applications for the military and the it department barely has any idea what theyre doing
2133	0	a	win apps still dominate because theyre so robust and developed
2134	0	a	to bring in new and old developers bring back the same functionality that is found in wpf and winforms
2140	0	a	assume the following xaml and not calling setdesiredbounds
2154	0	a	this is what the screen looks like
2155	0	a	sorry for the photo could not do a regular screen shot at the moment
2156	0	a	looks good
2157	0	a	yes video and transport controls cover the entire media player
2159	0	a	in full screen transport controls not video do also respect the safe area
2164	0	a	otherwise this looks cut and incomplete
2165	0	a	nevertheless so far this is ok and could be called as expected
2166	0	a	so far so good
2167	0	a	now lets turn on desiredboundsmode
2169	0	a	the safe area is removed and it looks like the following
2171	0	a	page has no more safe area but on the transport controls have suddenly the safe area even though the media player is part within the page
2172	0	a	for full screen it remains the same framed version as before so no additional screen shot why are transport controls no longer covering the entire video
2174	0	a	thats an real issue
2175	0	a	i am removing the safe area by calling setdesiredbounds and i am experiencing framed transport controls then even when using as control somewhere within the page
2177	0	a	i debugged this a lot and found a solution and realized a very dirty hack by microsoft
2178	0	a	in my app i am using custom transport controls and i used the original template as a starting point
2179	0	a	i found out that there is a grid element with xnamecontrolpanelgrid and on xbox it gets magically a margin of
2180	0	a	this is documented nowhere and has the bad effect described above
2181	0	a	removing the xname or renaming that element is enough the margin is gone
2182	0	a	nevertheless i would expect a less hacky solution
2184	0	a	having a safearea within a media elements transport controls when not fullscreen is definitely a bug
2185	0	a	and fiddling arround with a grid by name is just a dirty hack since this does not work with custom transport controls as long as the magic grid with its name is not present
2197	0	a	the mediaplayerelement supports various subtitle formats
2198	0	a	but when we play a video file using mediastreamsource it is not possible to pass through the subtitle streams because we cannot create mediastreamdescriptors for them
2199	0	a	so audio and video works but subtitles dont work
2201	0	a	this would be very helpful to make the ms initiated ffmpeginterop truly unviersally useful
2202	0	a	i am unable to use containers and vmwarevirtualbox on windows at the same time due to the restriction of hyperv
2203	0	a	this restriction does not exist on linux and macos
2204	0	a	why force me to reboot to disableenable hyperv
2205	0	a	why does hyperv lock out other virtualization software
2206	0	a	the wpf uniformgrid is missing in uwp
2207	0	a	it doesnt seem to quite have an equivalent in uwp in order to get even spacing of a grid automatically as well as other features like setting rowscolumns and first column for calendar type applications
2209	0	a	we need this so we can directly start searches within cortana from our apps
2213	0	a	camera app using display as a flash to lightup when using front facing camera
2216	0	a	a previous uservoice api to control screen brightness was marked closed after creators update with brightness control being introduced
2217	0	a	brightnessoverride would fit the purpose except it requires iot embedded mode and therefore cannot use this api
2221	0	a	clock app to control the brightness of display at night time
2226	0	a	apple announced support for fragmented mp backed hls streams under hls version at wwdc
2227	0	a	we are looking to change the way our hls streams are generated and windows seems to be one of the few platforms that doesnt support playing these type of streams
2231	0	a	i have to make a stub of the class in the local project which causes duplicate of code
2232	0	a	i submitted this to the vs forum but they said to post the issue here
2234	0	a	if the datatemplate xdatatypemodelslocalstatus references poco class that is in a seperate project the xaml will not compile
2239	0	a	we now have this option for listview and gridview but not for the combobox control
2241	0	a	the streamsocket class has no good way of polling the connection status without sending data your connection may have died minutes ago but you wont know until you try to send something which isnt desirable
2242	0	a	many of the old implementations in net and even in vb socket control had this functionality and it was highly useful
2243	1	a	the proposal is to add something like something happened update your ui or run your business logic
2248	0	a	while downloading a file with backgrounddownloader the progress updates every mb which is not really accurate
2249	0	a	ive noticed that pausing and resuming the download accelerates the update rate to about every ms
2251	0	a	this would allow us to easily use different itemtemplates for each group in conjunction with groupstyleselector
2252	0	a	there are many cases where you have different kind of data and group them by data type
2254	0	a	imagine a image viewer where you have one group folders and one group images
2256	0	a	or you display search results for various item types in one view
2257	0	a	it is possiblte to achieve this right now using the normal itemtemplateselector on listviewgridview
2258	0	a	but it causes a context switch from nativenet and back for each item which will slow down the control when showing a lot of items this is noticeable on slow devices or phones
2259	0	a	plus as i read in the docs this can degrade virtualization performace as the control does not know upfront which items need which template
2261	0	a	now the control does not need to call selector for every item speeding up the control
2271	0	a	m writing this feedback in desktop bridge because i think this team is the innovative and will do a better job of communicating these problems to windows store team
2272	0	a	desktop bridge attracts me as a developer but windows store puts me off
2274	0	a	currently the only way to find programs are if you type their names
2275	0	a	there are no keyword searches
2277	0	a	this has been like that for many years but no one has done anything about it
2278	0	a	if you wonder why developers are not jumping on to something as attractive as desktop bridge this is the reason
2281	0	a	there are many threads on internet discussing this issue but windows store team doesnt seem to listen
2292	0	a	otherwise the private store can only be used for inhouse apps or free apps
2293	0	a	a content control that enables the user to use inking to enter text in textboxes including richeditbox
2295	0	a	each javascript app that uses a video element in the ui and calls the play function to stream the video preview from camera to the app page will crash after recent windows update
2300	0	a	this crash occurs in all javascript apps that use the mediacapture api to display camera video previews
2301	0	a	for this reason apps programmed in javascript that use video or photo capturing are from now on nonfunctional in windows
2302	0	a	according to the documentation it is possible to xbind events to a handler
2308	0	a	when working with parameters this works as long as the parameters have the default names
2309	0	a	so for the calendarviewselecteddateschanged event the following signature works
2314	0	a	this behavior is not found in public documentation
2327	0	a	but i couldnt find any option in my dev center account to support this functionality
2328	0	a	in dx you cant read and write to the same texture and thats fine i can live with that
2329	0	a	however the api was designed that it will introduce severe overhead in the following scenario
2331	0	a	these objects are semitransparent alphablending so i need to draw them sorted by distance to camera back to front and not by state changes
2332	0	a	lets assume i have objects which are soft particles sp
2333	0	a	and objects that are triangle meshes tm
2334	0	a	both sp and tm use alpha blending
2335	0	a	sp dont do depth writes but they do depthtests and depth reads in the shader
2337	0	a	tm do depth writes and depth tests but they dont do depth reads in the shader
2338	0	a	by depth writes i mean the dddepthstencildescdepthwritemask
2339	0	a	so both sp and tm do legal operations they dont write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time
2340	0	a	however in the worst case when sp and tm are ordered in the following way
2342	0	a	i have to change the depth stencil view using omsetrendertargets for each draw call to set the same depth texture but with view that has dddsvreadonlydepth enabled or disabled
2344	0	a	so in order to draw them all i have to do
2350	0	a	to my understanding omsetrendertargets is a slow operation but i need to call it times
2351	0	a	and the calls to omsetrendertargets are really useless because the same depth texture is used just with a different view and because both sp and tm do legal operations they dont write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time
2357	0	a	i dont need to create depth stencil views for each depth buffer one with dddsvreadonlydepth enabled and one with disabled
2358	0	a	i dont need to call omsetrendertargets for each draw call where i want to change dddsvreadonlydepth
2359	0	a	but i just stick to normal depth writes dddepthstencildescdepthwritemask
2361	0	a	this artificial limitation is also the cause for bugs in webgl in chromefirefox
2363	0	a	once you start working on webgl in ms edge you will notice that you will encounter the same problem because in gleswebgl its legal to read from the depth texture while its bound to the fbo and you will have to do checks for each draw call if depth stencil view needs to be changed to have dddsvreadonlydepth or no
2368	0	a	say i have objects to draw
2373	0	a	sp dont do depth writes but they do depthtests more
2375	0	a	see github issue for more information and scenarios
2377	0	a	its extremely annoying when i face service issues with devcenter with no knowledge if they are investigated or not
2378	0	a	i dont want all the time contact support wait wait wait and yeah we have issues or now is just saturdayive to wait til monday
2379	0	a	with service issue i mean devcenter backend is down or doesnt work properly in some ways
2381	0	a	at least were not totally in the dark in a limbo where we dont know if the issue is just a transient one or a serious one and we have to way days
2390	0	a	mapcontrol crashing whole app with the following stacktrace
2391	0	a	please conntact me for a code to reproduce this crash
2393	0	a	this would allow the app to process messages asynchronously without pairing
2394	0	a	some devicesapps do not have the ability of input pairingpassword
2395	0	a	the main impediments when creating a chatlike control using a listview is that we dont have a native way to handle incrementalloading at the top of list
2396	1	a	there is already an example we can reuse in uwp samples
2398	0	a	wanted to use list to work on automating the installer for a container image and theres a check in place that blocks this scenario because the sdk is already installed
2401	0	a	download windows sdk on a machine with windows sdk installed
2406	0	a	the webview control doesnt allow printing embedded pdfs etc
2408	0	a	if it works in edge chrome and firefox it should work in webview control
2409	0	a	not sure why even having a web browser control if it isnt going to have full browser features minus the tabs settings url input box etc
2411	0	a	since edge doesnt support lockdown usage like ie did with kiosk mode it makes it even more important to have this
2412	0	a	i add a customaudioeffect which is eq ive also tried using official uwp samples echoeffect to mediaplayer
2413	0	a	although it seems customaudioeffect is running on worker thread not ui thread it seems media playback would also be impact when ui loading a bit heavier
2414	0	a	i could hear my music become intermittently
2417	1	a	now that xaml and directx support svg images id love to provide my splash screen image as an svg file
2420	0	a	so often the png splash screen is larger than all of the apps compiled code
2421	0	a	id also be ok using a xaml path
2425	0	a	apple has such a form and on the few occasions that ive needed to use it theyve generally completed a review in a few hours
2426	0	a	this is useful for situations where a critical security flaw is identified or where a trade show or other immovable deadline requires an app get through the review process more quickly than usual
2427	0	a	i found a similar suggestion made back in which was closed when the certification expectation time was lowered to three days
2428	0	a	three days is not fast enough for many common scenarios

2438	0	a	the current usb api is lacking the ability to specify which usb port number to use rather than the device vendoridproductid
2440	0	a	i have two identical usb zebra printers and cannot tell them apart
2442	0	a	the current support for bluetooth le in win creators update does not allow publishing of an eddystone beacon because the api reserves the use of many data section types
2443	0	a	this limits the capability of the btle publishing api to manufacturer specific payloads
2447	0	a	the closet option is to launch it fullscreen but that obscures the task bar
2448	0	a	auto give little control over the first launch of the app
2449	0	a	this meant that i ended up using preferredlaunchviewsize during first launch and then auto on subsequent launches
2450	0	a	this is what i am currently using applicationviewwindowingmodeauto applicationviewwindowingmodepreferredlaunchviewsize
2461	0	a	this seems a bad way to manage window size
2471	0	a	this is what i am currently using
2483	0	a	bug setting preferredlaunchwindowingmode before preferredlaunchviewsize is set results in undefined behavior
2490	0	a	bug preferredlaunchviewsize must be x or higher at first launch assuming scale size

2516	0	a	masterdetail with xbind is not working properly
2517	0	a	when you use xbind to bind a textbox to a property of the selecteditem of a listview this problem exists
2519	0	a	you select a new item in the listview
2521	0	a	your changes from are lost because the selection in the listview changes before the lostfocusevent of the textbox was raised
2522	0	a	that means the change was never written back to the original item

2526	0	a	the updatetask or preconfigurationtask capabilities are good examples
2529	0	a	as its very inconvenient to have to wait for business days to have a response and you may need to have your app on the store in less time depending on an urgency which i have due to needing to have my app passed for one of my love ones who have passed away

2566	0	a	as well as a return method that allows you to return to the dialog before it after the new dialog has run such as if you want a returning password entry or something
2574	0	a	im considering rewriting it as a queue for dialogs as currently it will only display one dialog and queue one dialog meaning if you try to queue two it will fail
2575	0	a	this is a helper to ensure safe handling of content dialogs this will help prevent exceptions from trying to open a content dialog when one is already open
2576	0	a	methods involve async and non async opening if you want the result or not these methods have a boolean that lets you specify whether you want to wait for the dialog before it to close before showing it so you can show break through dialogs such as error or password prompts

2691	0	a	when adding or removing a lot of items we suspend the events and will raise a single event for all the items that were changed during the suspension period
2693	0	a	before recent changes we were abusing the reset event type to inform the ui components that the collection has changed
2694	0	a	in the current version we have optimized the collection so it knows exactly what has changed in the suspension state
2695	0	a	we will only invoke the correct add remove actions for all the items

2737	0	a	when using a company store account with associated developer accounts its presently not possible for the developers to raise support issues for store problems

2741	0	a	winappdriver does not work with windowsfindby annotation because appiumfielddecorator forces the get context command which is not supported by winappdriver
2742	0	a	i understand winappdriver does not currently support webview and therefore it does not support context switching so context command is not provided
2743	0	a	however the context switching is not required to support windowsfindby annotated element
2745	0	a	then appium will happily use the native locator
2746	0	a	i can get the page source with current winappdriver and i see all the elements returned have the attributes for size width height or positionx y but the values of those attribute are all zero
2747	0	a	i think this is the reason why appium inspector does not highlight the element position in the screenshot images when an element was selected in the app source tree or clicking on the screenshot does not select the corresponding element in the app source tree

2768	0	a	afther loged in user confirmation the dialog closes and no forther finguerprint detection is possible
2769	0	a	i dont know is this is a security norm from microsoft to not allow outside settings finguer detection
2772	0	a	and how develop more library for correctly use multiuser finguerprint registration and detection
2773	0	a	thank you jose lopes
2784	0	a	each number represents the shadow in each side
2788	0	a	in percent of cases i receive measureoverride exception or error hresult efail has been returned from a call to a com component no matter what the problem is youll get that kind of useless information
2789	0	a	which means that something went wrong
2790	0	a	no stacktrace and guess yourself is what winrt development looks like
2793	0	a	i am using richtextbox for editing the rtf text
2794	0	a	initially if i have rtf text in first line and then after adding bullets to the same line the bullets does not appears in same color font and font family
2795	0	a	if the device is connected to a network speech recognition with local srgs custom grammar it behaves exactly as if it did not have the local grammar and starts to communicate to the websocketsplatformbingcom endpoint increasing by tens of times the waitingtime for the result
2798	0	a	even the official microsoft uwp sample accuses the same problem
2801	0	a	for large teams just having one team member being able to do this is a bad design decision
2802	0	a	the api is fine but where i am running into trouble is that things like flyouts and dialogs intercept any and all access to the event
2803	0	a	event registration order doesnt seem to make a difference
2804	0	a	this makes for problems with things like
2807	0	a	the splitview captures the first backrequested rather than the page navigation
2809	0	a	a flyout with custom picker ui that uses backrequested to navigate internally
2811	0	a	im a developer trying to make a discord app for windows phone windows tablet xbox and hololens
2812	0	a	it is a significant limitation to not have an opus supported library and makes many features impossible
2814	0	a	ive tried to use the microsoftconnecteddevicesxamarindroid with xamarinforms apps but its difficult because the platform related methods such as oauth are tied to the implementation of android activity
2816	0	a	a type of horizontal one row listviewgridview
2818	0	a	only horizontal scrolling available because its one row only
2822	0	a	when the user will press button for next items then items will scroll and next set of items will appear on the screen
2824	0	a	example best example is the youtube homepage has this control where suggested videos from different channels are shown in single row
2831	0	a	scrollingnavigation buttons on right side next button on left side of the control will be a previous button
2832	0	a	nextprevious behaviour the available screen will show the max number of items in the row of the control according to size of the control and size of the items in it
2836	0	a	i havent found any possible way to do that so i assume it doesnt exist currently
2838	0	a	the serialdevice implementation appears to be very unstable in general but doubly so when compiling as native
2839	0	a	the following will reliably throw some flavor of interop exception
2840	0	a	this will reliably result in a bsod if zero bytes are returned not clear why loadasync isnt blocking either
2842	0	a	as of now its only possible to set the calenderidentifier property to tell the control which calender to use
2843	0	a	its not possible to set the hijri adjustment for the month of ramadanshaban though which can vary per regionuser some users like to use the adjustment of a different country
2844	0	a	the windows calender app show cases this feature with their calender when you set the alternative calender to hijri a new setting shows up which is hijri adjustment and it works nice
