9566	this would enable live traffic aware apps
9569	please try other formatting like bold italics shadow to distinguish titlessubtitles from content
9576	since computers were invented to save time i suggest we be allowed to upload them all in one zip file using numbering for the file names and the portal could place them in the right order
9577	allow rearranging if the user wants to change them
9579	add simd instructions for better use of arm neon instructions for math and games
9580	also using a hot swapping code generator optimized machine code like hotspot in java does would also be very helpful to mitigate slow c code
9587	microsoft should seriously look into getting rid of symantec for all these payment stuff
9599	i would be extremely useful in a variety of app types to be notified upon call started and ended events at least be able to check whether or not the device is being used for a phonecall
9626	i would like to see informatin about the certification process in the dev center app
9628	it would be nice to see at a glance if an app is featured in one of the markets
9630	also i would be fun to have a record showing the featured markets and dates
9636	make progressring control available for windows phone just like win
9657	it would be great if the os moved on to the second third etc nfc record and tried to trigger off of them until there was a success
9660	we need for our applications on each of the mobile platforms to be able to read data on a separate ndef records contained in an ndef message
9670	provide process classapis like that for regular windows to develop lower level operations like task manager in windows
9686	please add the possibility the set price market distribution and trial mode existence individually for the xaps
9702	add the ability to do memory profiling on background agent periodic as they are limited on memory and sometimes its too hard to catch memory leaks
9706	either one has to use net to access a library or microsoft advises to do a net app with native code in a winrt component
9709	dont limit us artifically just because you dont like native developers
9735	these page templates should be updated to use the mediumsized semibold font by default for the title text
9750	taskbased operations would make the code much more clean and readable
9754	add a boolean to cameracapturetask to indicate whether you want it to save the picture taken to be saved to the camera roll
9755	please expose etw logging namespaces like systemdiagnosticseventing so that it is possible to log events from the windows app
9756	currently the only way to take advantage of the direct manipulation in a xaml windows store app is by using a scrollviewer
9794	instead of having a top charts style listing where the most popular apps are displayed to every phone anywhere create a new form of distribution where the results are randomized every time a user looks at the marketplace
9796	highly rated apps should appear near the top more and they should appear less and less frequently and the rating of the app dwindles
9799	it seems to me that all good appsgames should have a chance at decent exposure in the top charts and waiting to be featured just isnt worth it
9819	maybe you should think about some way to reward those users who take their time to actually try an app and review it
9829	it would be great to be able to use the wp emulator and surface emulator for that matter for mobility demonstrations ie when i deliver a dynamics crm demo i often nearly always want to include mobility scenarios on the same screen as the rest of the demo
9873	it will even allow seamless migration to new hardware
9926	i would like to ask microsoft to give us a tooloption in emulator with which we can take screenshots once in one emulator and it will produce screenshots in all resolutions and all languages supported by our app
9929	you have to run one emulator take screenshots close it and run another and so on
9978	sharpdx proves that those key technologies can be made available to csharp i would suggest to either support the project or to provide your own interface
9980	it would be more natural to allow the physical search key to activate the search function on the active application rather than loading bing which is rarely the goal
9994	associate bound objects to data templates implicitly by type instead of explicitly by template name
10007	for more information see data binding
10027	on wp add optional support to hook these hardware keys press events for the lens plugin featureshardware keys should include vol vol stage light press camera shutter stage deep press camera shutter
10028	when an application has problems or when a problem is detected in advance by the developer until the publication of the correction version the client is without knowing what is happening it would be possible for microsoft to implement a communications resource developer for customers who have installed its application
10168	readwrite accsess to email sync settings could enable applications to create custom sync profiles based on weekdays time position etc
10203	it s impossible to connect easily to ftp network i suggest to include it in the future sdk
10204	i hope microsoft can open asia voice function fastest
10212	we need support special multitasking tasks like voip and im
10260	please add the possibility to add your own spell check service or provide the data if a system wide one existed
10267	if microsoft created some incentives like a free device blackberry did this and a free year of membership amazon did this it could drive a lot of developers to the platform which is crucial to the platform taking off
10297	i would be a really nice gesture to have an option which can put everything to the other side so when left handed people scroll they could also see the content
10389	it would be great to be able to have the emulator location data use the nmea file format either via file importexport or using the files directly as a feed
10408	currently you can only pin an album but it would be useful if you can pin a single image as a tile that way you have easy access to a it
10459	why shouldnt i as user be able to see reviews made by people from other countries
10469	for apps that synchronize or connect to networks sporadically it would be handy to have an easy way to detect if you are on a cheap connection so if wifi is connected or the device is connected to the web via usb
10474	so suggestion is to add properties like iswificonnected and iscableconnected to devicenetworkinformation that execute fast
10492	give developers good explanation what they do wrong and enforce good design
10494	apps should take no longer than seconds to start and need to explain why they would take longer
10540	please provide apis for call forwarding and other call management functionsholdunholdswapconferenceetc
10541	as a user i would like to be able to select songs that i have put on the device from my library to wake up to
10573	thus this idea is actually for the developers to make scrolling faster after each subsequent scroll like every scrolls the scrolling speed will increase
10583	in addition the user should be able to take a scree shot within the multitasking area by using a finger gesture to drag the app towarda the bottom of the screen a screen capture icon should appear and the outer edges of the icon should fill with green and onve the edges are completly green a photograph noise will occur allow with a sudden screen flare to tell the user the screen shot has been taken and saved in the saved images folder
10600	we need the ability for developers to add relevant tags to their app descriptions we then need the ability to search for apps with those tags tags should also be verified during app submission to ensure theyre relevant
10633	it will be pleasant to go the main page of the app in the marketplace to see the general prsentation screenshots the other users reviews
10636	allow user to send video audio and more pictures in an mms now only one pic is supported
10649	allow access to raw data such as signal strength imformation to allow creation of indoor location positioning using available wifi bluetooth or cellular networks when no gps data is available
10655	since windows phones are selling hot in countries like india browser should start displaying indian language characters
10677	and a smart dialer can then be a full alternative to the builtin phone app since the app also can have a quickbutton for goto the regular phone app whenever the user wants to do that
10678	as an alternative to giving writeaccess to calendar which can be hard to get a go on for security reasons let us at least open an appointment directly in the calendar app
2861	signal strength directly impacts video playback experience
2864	but reusing the operating system component saves us development effort and ensures it looks as expected as the operating system evolves
2874	you can ask for a request but its not clear what and when something will happen
2894	with windows you have the ui app and the service app hosted locally may be the iis express used during local debug can be used
2897	this new approach of developing applicaitons simlifies the ui development where developer get rid of learning other technologies like java scriptangularjquerystyle sheets and all those n number of scripts
2903	typical problem here would be deploymentinstallationupdate of the ui application to client machine but if we simplify this process of deployment like having the rules that the ui app should be only one obfuscated executable file it should not depend on reference more
2909	bonus points for it to be xaml standard compliant
2913	in addition this will allow a greater prominence of xaml standard and greater acceptance in the market and in the media
2927	dont require developers to use the background task builder and background triggers just to activate an app in the background
2930	a control that offers hour minute second selection would be helpful
2931	add to collectionviewsource function pointer to get the group objects not just propertypath
2935	a datepickerflyout whose date is twoway bound will update targettosource but not sourcetotarget
2940	when functions and fallbackvalue is used in an xbind at same time the parameter must match exactly
2955	playback seamlessly between one media and another
2977	a control for visualizing and editing networks graphs and flowcharts
2996	leave them alone
3000	does not make sense that an idle task would be suspended for not being busy enough
3001	making the task more busy to work around idle tasks being suspended would mean more battery usage kind of the opposite of what you want
3011	microsoft wants us to build more connected app with project rome api
3019	in we can extend brush by xamlcompositionbrushbase
3029	it also annoys during development because now my solution has to have target platforms while it could just have one
3034	what i want is to drag and drop a file then be able to get its full path and file name as stored on the disk and access it using standard c io file access functions such as fopen fread etc
3035	i dont want to use xaml because it looks complicated it looks like it can reduce performance i am making d heavy directx based applications that need full performance
3045	for example i drag and drop a bmp image my app compresses it and saves as png image automatically in the same folder with the same name
3057	dual screen google card glass fulfill the function and make the application very attractive
3064	we wanna to commuicate other app in desktop
3065	not only other uwp but wpf application
3073	ive done the same tests in uwp mode using dxgiswapeffectflipdiscard and results were the same slow as in winwinapi
3082	from what i see astc would be great for that have good quality but also small size looks like it has lot of format options so i could choose what i want
3102	im pretty sure the new treeview is not fall creators update dependent
3115	map became unusable after phone update
3118	resolvecompleted event comes after ten seconds
3123	d lines on traffic layer are blurred jagged and looking bad
3127	while nice looking uwp ui is not well suited for creating uiheavy classic applications think visualstudioautocadblenderlobs with a lot of data that you would never want to use on tabletphone
3135	if our isv uwp app also have this feature we can spent more time to trying the new feature and insider customer and testers can use it and we could got feedbacks
3153	because if you currently assign a binding a visualstate setter as below it will resolve the value of the binding and assign that to the target while you would like to assign the binding itself
3154	this will allow designs and implementations to change bindings depending on states and even help some states where some bindings are not required to be temporarily set to xnull for performance handy in complex screens
3167	we can see the entries added in the registry but client cannot access the interfaces
3176	for example lets say i want to create shorthand for aligning a control inside relativepanel fully horizontal like alignhorizontalwithpanel
3183	allows desktop apps to incrementally adopt ui innovations and creates a bridge to uwp for app ui
3184	i tried the converted app using ime
3188	we want to improve support google ime
3194	i thinks its not difficult to do since cortana for computer supports up to languages as listed on
3240	you can verify this with the camerastreamcorrelation sample
3243	the following streams are available on the pc
3248	the following streams are available on the xbox
3253	are there any plans to support skeleton tracking on the xbox
3256	it seems such a shame that the new kinect drivers expose the kinect via this api and yet the exposurecontrol is marked as being not supported for the kinect
3257	from the libfreenect library it seems entirely possible to tell the kinect not to do autoexposure
3261	i expect that the content set directly the text to persist after closing the application
3264	to me something that may cause a runtime crash and that the compiler clearly knows to flag should not a warning but an error
3270	xbox dev mode companion work ipv please
3271	make it really smooth to update code of a uwp app like you are already doing with the xaml part the app is automatically reloaded without being shut down and relaunched
3284	a xaml designer for visual studio in windows
3304	the control would allow for the use of the contact picker but allows for manual entry and deletion of contacts
3309	to give the user a sense of consistency the file picker remembers the last location that the user navigated to and will generally start at that location
3311	this is not always the best solution for example pretend you had a uwp app that asked the user to select a picture and a music file
3336	i am migrating my app from windows desktop using core audio api to uwp using hopefully audiograph
3348	we are exploring moving forward with uwp but currently there is no way to access the pipeline to add custom shaders and models like we do now in virtual earth with microsoftmappointgraphicsdgraphicsengined and microsoftmappointrenderingdscenestep
3357	im developing a java application so interop with c is kinda tricky while interop shell api or c libraries is pretty easy and straightforward with jna
3386	it is very difficult to create a custom richeditbox with all the basic features like text formatting bullets and numbering support for inking like onenote and also to support adaptive layout thats too much work for basic text editing
3390	im creating app using face detection
3394	if we put the mkv in another service or server the video is reproduced but the connection with onedrive has been lost
3417	it stops on the way
3430	chinese and italian support have already been asked for
3434	in some cases an access error may occur at the time of opening a file or it may be opened correctly
3435	we want a solution
3527	something seems to have changed with loggingchannel possibly default manifest code that handles the string message has changed around
3528	fwiw preview versions of windows post anniversary update were showing the message correctly
3530	id like to have implicit datatemplates in uwp
3535	currently i can only input plain text in toast notification input since the type does not support password
3574	developers need to have good and deep understanding of how ui virtualization works on uwp app
3600	currently you can use the pivot or there are rdparty vendors providing a tabcontrol
3686	im converting some wpf apps to uwp and i am missing a report control
3697	please open up the base classes for inheritance and provide a sample how to create a custom virtualizing panel
3706	without this uwp is more or less a toy because any customization requires that the app be deployed completely separately
3718	this is only relevant for desktop uwp apps
3722	you can at least provide any of these solutions
3748	id use this for my media phone playing groove
3766	the panorama control is still the best control for my app and my users love it
3767	updating the app to uwp is not possible without this control
3785	currently there is no way to prevent menuflyout from closing when user click any of its items
3786	im not even sure if it is not a bug because setting argscancel in closing event is not working
3791	support io transactions on uwp platform as part of windows runtime api for file io
3796	for example three quick touch strokes to scroll immediately to the top or bottom
3797	really long lists and views are boring to scroll even at maximum scroll speed
3798	keyboard have homeend keys to scroll to topbottom but touch screen doesnt have same capability
3816	but this library is fairly lowlevel
3841	that concept is painfully evident when using microsofts edge browser and you want to browse various favorites menus
3844	specifically excellent mouse support means that menus will support all the hover actions that menus currently enjoy in win applications
3846	the current situation requires two mouse clicks to accomplish the same thing as a simple hover should
3857	i dont know what the component should look like
3861	it can happen that sometimes we do need a control to store a list of pageselements that looks like a pivot control but with a infinite list of pageselements
3873	so i tried to find other ways such as excel access or sql server compact edition
3891	so application would request secret api keys as needed from systemprovided secure storage
3893	release appx shouldnt have secret keys inside and keys should be on windows store server and those keys would be requested from server on application install
3918	another advantage is the developer already have a preview in design mode
3929	the idea would be to have a try button on every sample
3930	this button will generate a ready to use visual studio project with the current sample
3931	it seems that animated gifs disappear when application minimizes restores
3956	allow the user to select items drag them around and resize them
3964	we currently have a store app that works with our desktop app and it causes a great deal of confusion
3971	if you need anything from me for any reason i will do what ever i need to do to improve our software for our users
3979	as developer i want to create custom picker like date or time pickers
3991	you cant scroll at that point
4014	in an xaml page there are some buttons and command bar buttons both of which have access keys set
4046	i am working on porting an app that could calculate md checksums on a file
4081	being an enterprise developer the advent of big data i believe the seadragon pivotviewer lastest binaries should be ported over to wpfuwp apps as it is a well needed tool
4085	since we are preparing a custom control with the scrollviewer the look and feel is not nice
4089	microsoft is loosing a huge market by not supporting a full net standard
4097	evidently the mediacompositionsaveasync api internally uses the storageapplicationpermissionsfutureaccesslists api which has a limitation of items
4098	if you add more than clips created via mediaclipcreatefromimagefileasync the api will fail with this exception
4100	an item must be removed before another item is added
4101	additional information the maximum number of items for the access list has been reached
4110	in case app is installed in sd card and notification uses custom audio file default notification sound is played instead of custom audio file
4117	in the end developers have to use some workarounds to simulate old behavior
4118	you can see that even apps list in wm simulates old behavior instead of default one
4133	when using fm radio i have my headphones plugged in
4140	this would make replying to messages etc
4169	i know its not possible at the moment specially with all the hardware limitations but if you guys really are working on a surface phone bringing visual studio to it will be so huge
4177	the problem is the output port names are enumerated by the uwp api as just midi and not the name of the port as defined when they were setup
4178	reaper and other desktop programs are displaying the proper name
4192	including windowsh shouldnt generate compile warnings even the extra ones
4222	that would make all the users happy
4224	hololens lets you render on backbuffersstereoscopic but its hard to know if the output is correct because the emulator shows just one frame
4228	there is a bug in uwp where special characters are interpreted as letters when using multi layered keyboard layout like the german neo layout
4232	its also a total annoyance when working with data that require handling of lots of special charecters like json and xml data
4249	looking forward to the progress youre doing d
4250	with project rome i can discover devices of others connect with them and launch apps or leverage app services once consent has been established
4256	this feature is implemented in the accessory api which is restricted to only smart watch makers
4261	this would allow them to know that additional awesome features are there
4265	the windows display language of my computer is set to enus because i am an app developer and most app problems and solutions are written in english
4271	such functionality is common to music apps in google play store apple store blackberry world
4272	in most cases such apps can be ported to uwp platform and because they are coming from a posixlinux the network api is bsd sockets as well as some complex network communication libraries can be used to support this or that networkoriented functionality
4273	currently the network data flow is boroken once app goes into background or screen is switched off
4287	can inapp purchases made available to windows store for business
4293	these channels are not accessible with the current audiograph apis
4317	it has support for linux and i think windows should gain support too
4329	and the dac folder is empty
4353	hello dev team
4366	in the app settings you can disabled the swipeopen or make the swipein detection area wider if the users phone makes getting close to the screen edge difficult
4382	so there should be a way to either swap out style xaml rsourcedictionary files andor pieces of more
4388	any feedback is appreciated thanks john
4402	xaml apps can detect it but there is no equivalent winrt api for js apps
4404	my html perfectly fine in windows but not in windows mobile
4428	as an information this is the xaml control that contain the complex attributeproperty
4442	in my opinion this feature is really fundamental much more important to me than many new features that appears regularly
4456	according to the documentation the proper way to handle input in a store app is to create a coreindependentinputsource from another thread by calling swapchainpanelcreatecoreindependentinputsource
4464	devices with touch input are the ones that suffer the most from this bug since they come with weak gpus
4465	devs have to chose either low responsiveness or low performance
4484	the application will exit
4501	having an api allowing getting the color of the pixels under a pointer eventually throttledasync and only when having pointer capture on would increase the expressiveness of the creation tools in uwp applications
4522	i am manually having to keep a list of these when it would be easily managed in the dashboard if the status properly reflected this
4526	the current status only seems to show in progress if the app has never been put in the store before
4537	meanwhile the perf counters are difficult to associate with a specific application requiring the request queue be named which httplistener does not do and netsh called to find url group ids to use for correlation
4545	i did a research on audioframeoutputnode it is strange that it often generate audioframe without any audio data the audioframes duration property is miliseconds but the relativetime property is not
4553	for example a user send us a feedback to ask a windows rt version of our app but now we are focused on windows so we need to be clear that we read his feedback but its not on our roadmap
4555	after that the age rating questionnaires stop submitting when you press submit
4572	an example of this an application as a node in an internal media network would be something along the lines of audiobus for ios
4575	extrapolate the above capabilities to audio allowing onthefly addremove interconnectablereroutable audio nodes virtual interface devices to which appsdevices would attach to instead of attaching only to hardware interfaces
4578	same for video not only making desktopwindow screen capture a breeze and naturally handle by the os it would also allow the creation of virtual screens resource permitting of course for desktop expansionmirroring outputting them to a video inputrecording apps usb or even to a dlna receiver screens
4582	this would allow the user through the os to detach an app media output from its default interface audiomidi card screenwindow and reattach it to another app or device input
4587	what if we will exchange apps reviews
4590	i like the ease of the app and recommend this app to all
4593	i have largely ignored this is the past because it was minimal but someone is finding good success with it so theyre hammering everyone
4594	personally i am getting a day from different source email addresses
4595	removing the support email from the webpage would not hinder the user as they can see it via the windows store app
4605	a user is at lunch viewing their sensitive documents
4606	they switch to their email app our application detects active state change and auto logs out
4607	they finish their food and leave but forget their phone on the table
4608	at this point a perpetrator is able to take the phone open the recent apps section and now can see whatever our client was looking at
4609	user is at their desktop observing files gets up and makes the app inactive minimizes or moves to back
4610	we begin a timer to auto log out
4611	a perpetrator is able to hover over the taskbar item and see the last screen drawn whether or not the user logged out
4620	sorry if i sound bitter but i must say its very frustrating developing for w mobile at the moment even if the you get good reviews the chance of them being displayed in the store is very slim due to the version fragmentation
4621	as i understand it insider reviews that arent on the slow ring are removed even worse theyre deleted permanently from even the developer dashboard
4622	people took time to write thoughtful reviews and theyre simply deleted
4623	ive started to continually download review reports to just have a record of them
4624	ive had over fifty star reviews simply disappear never to be seen again
4625	i see the point that insiders shouldnt bring down the ratings of the app if the os is to blame but with so few people rating anyway and most people being on the fast insider ring it makes it extremely hard to get reviews
4626	old windows phone retain their status of being the most highly rated just because of this
4627	whats the point of having a rule if that means theres too few reviews and no point for most people to post reviews at all
4628	im not quite sure what a good solution is you cold allow only reviews for fast insiders but i guess that might skew reviews too positively
4629	or why not let the text review stand even if the rating doesnt count
4631	as it is getting an accurately impressions of apps through reviews doesnt seem feasible
4651	the caller does not have the required permission to perform this operation
4668	iot introduced the windowssystemprocesslauncher for starting arbitrary programs like processstart in net
4674	note when executed dns client service crashes
4676	comment out the textattributes line and note service does not crash
4679	i have bound the ispaneopen of my splitview to a property in my viewmodel
4680	this works nicely except when the splitview is in overlay mode and the user presses a hardware back button on the phone
4681	in this case the splitviewpane gets closed as expected but it does that by seemingly overwriting the binding on ispaneopen and instead setting it directly to the value false
4682	the effect is that the panel can never be opened again as my code will do this by setting the vm property to true but the binding was already lost
4685	in practical terms you are forced to make a ui technology diversion to implement new functionality
4686	xaml doesnt look a tempting option because not useful for mobile or web and needed controls usually implemented in javascript first
4687	at a application architectural level porting winforms to htmljs favours an entirely new application which follows an understoodaccepted architectural pattern then reimplement old functionality
4689	so imagine the app in question was one written by an exemployee in in vbnet with deep domainknowledge targeting users with similar domain knowledge for a specialist task with no design documentation beyond a description of a manual process it replaced
4690	well this is the norm and for all its wrongs its there
4691	never had budget assigned in the first place and its used by people who are all busy
4693	given the architectural barrier is the killler i dont believe there is any feature of gdi which cannot be expressed in html
4694	the ui may not adhere to good gui design principals its performance may suck but it probably wont
4695	but its users can start it and it will look and act the same as it did before arcane controls and all
4696	the architecture of a modern html appliication has much more in common with gdi and a windows message loop than it does with xaml
4697	things like redux essentially go out of their way to be like a message loop to avoid race conditions through async operations
4698	for microsoft this would i believe solve a massive developer stumbling block even allowing winforms controls to potentially be integrated in html uis
4705	so imagine the app in question was one written by an more
4706	microsoft finally developed a library able to handle nfc devices
4707	unfortunately the library is only able to get the ndef messages and doesnt give the uid of the card
4708	is there a reason why this uid is not saved in the proximitydevice once the nfc card is read
4711	but it has no similar property on uwps api
4713	you reproduce this on mobile build system
4714	currently there is no way to attach debugger to already running process via attach to process on mobile
4715	and sometimes bad bugs like deadlocks happens
4716	and its real pain to investigate them since usually they happen without debugger and on release builds
4717	windows mobile is like back box you cant get full access to
4722	frankly speaking i am surprised that it was not there from the very beginning
4743	all that happens without any real user attendance which makes those triggers useless
4744	in wm there was an unattended power state for that situation and there was a way to detect real user interaction with the device
4746	current behavior of systemtriggeruseraway and userpresent is unexpected
4748	phone is sleeping with screen turned off
4750	some event occurs sms incoming call toast
4754	usernotificationchangedtrigger fired
4756	userpresent trigger fired
4758	after some short timeout screen goes off
4764	this is my personal favourite mobile file open picker the app suspends but it cannot be debugged
4765	all sorts of surprises can happen with a complex app
4766	before uwp currentculture reflected the regional settings format and currentuiculture reflected the display language
4769	we shoulnt have to relly on workaround like this one
4772	it would be a lot like facebook messengers chat heads
4775	so many things could be done with it
4776	i found that phonetriggertype enum includes useful triggers except the trigger when a call is received
4786	torch api doesnt work in lumia with windows phone support such as lumia
4788	currently uwp have less readable grayscale font smoothing
4789	it makes uwp apps look worse than desktop apps on standard dpi screens
4791	sometimes compassgetdefault returns null and compass stop working in all apps
4792	to solve i need to restart the phone
4794	in the following msdn magazine article it is mentioned that there are some limits for voice command deffiniton files
4799	i use windows sapi quite intensively for an application i have built and many grammars are easily much bigger than the limits imposed by cortana
4800	this makes it a bit tricky to port the recognition engine part of the application away from sapi and towards cortana since sapi provides more powerful capabilities for larger sets of commands
4810	unfortunately i am not going to know all uris the cookies are in without tracking every single domain visited which is what i currently have to do
4811	i do this so i can clear all cookies
4812	an api that would take minutes for someone to write up and save me a lot of coding is
4814	or secondary to that a deleteallcookies or clearcookies api as that is the only reason i need to get all of them and i cant think of any other use cases to retrieve all cookies
4815	happy to go either way
4825	user interaction depends on it
4826	searched up and down to get this done in windows no success
4827	similar has been accomplished in pre
4828	used win ce where ms granted more access to source code
4832	pedestrianfeaturesvisible can be toggle only if mapstyle is set on road
4834	currently when using a controlchanneltrigger with httpclient you cannot send a https request without the application getting terminated by the system
4836	i tested using https and to my surprise it does work with the debugger attached no exceptions get thrown so it is implemented
4837	however termination occurs when the application is not connected to the debugger
4840	audiograph created with custom desiredsamplesperquantum ignores it and uses default ms quantum
4843	depending on hardware you may hear gaps right after start or you may need load cpu with some additional work like scrolling ui or running some work in background threads
4844	i guess it is result of extremely short quantum size ms even switching between threads could take more time and too low buffer length quants but it could be just some synchronization issue
4846	slider renders to extreme right value instead of zero
4847	i have an app where i use a custom title bar by extending my view into the title bar area
4849	then i also use code like this to allow a custom element to support dragging of the window
4851	this all was implemented preanniversary update
4852	while all this works fine a bug was introduced in the anniversary update where the title bar returns zero for height systemoverlayrightinset and systemoverlayleftinset now
4854	i confirmed that in preanniversary update these properties would return values like for height and for systemoverlayrightinset
4873	the use of the file type filter makes no sense when you are picking a folder and its not menioned in the documentation
4875	suppose we have an app with two modes like zune normal and mini
4876	in the mini mode the app only presents the indispensable and small elements on the window
4879	i know maybe its not at the microsofts priority list but i believe we can somehow make it available
4882	but that would be nice
4883	we do like to build universal windows apps
4893	at the moment it is possible to install to the application install directory but the files there cannot be altered by the application
4894	if the application copies the files to the application data folder after installation as done in my work around it cannot delete the original files in the installation folder by this having two versions
4896	after the anniversary update the store shows default the ratings of current version
4897	this is very annoying for developers of good and populair apps
4898	a potential user viewing in the store will most likely make his judgement to download based on the number of reviews and quality of reviews especially since the windows store does not show the total number of downloads
4900	so for app publishers this will be a reason to keep app updates to an absolute minimum in order to get as many ratings as possible
4902	or at least last days
4911	i want to know it to make custom title bar that looks exactly as defult one except with my controls
4912	im able to get systemaccentbrush but i cant get actual window title bars color becouse it depends on this show accent color setting
4913	ive already asked the forum where you can find the detailed description on the issue
4917	if often misclassify the direction
4918	ps i didnt know where to post this but since the library is in windowsmediaocr namespace i put it under media
4919	using resources in a datatemplate worked just fine before
4920	now that ive upgraded to anniversary and installed the newest sdk and tools the newest visual studio update it doesnt work as expected at all
4930	this will crash on instantiation because somehow the viewmodel object is null when the bindings are updated which was definitely not the case in previous versions and surely not the expected behavior
4931	if i replace the xbind with a binding it will run but if using the datatemplate for multiple objects for example in a gridview the resource will have the same value for all instances which makes it really pointless
4946	some apps have such poor startup perf that ngen is must
4948	or since this is a store app will the standard background ngen work for wpf apps
4949	i do not like the recent change in the dev center
4950	first of all it shows cumulative acquisitions rather than for a specified amount of time making it hard to compare which apps people like more if an app has been available longer of course the cumulative acquisitions will be higher
4951	also being able to see only some of the apps at the same time is very frustrating
4954	currently it is part of a sample
4958	as simple as clickonce publishing
4959	i do not want to convert msis
4972	right now the new devcenter offers the ability to sort by apps by included markets baseprice and last modified
4975	i can see it when i go to definition on serialdevice
4977	in order to break my codes dependency on actual hardware so i could automate my tests i had to reinvent the wheel
4978	by keeping this interface internal i was forced to recreate the interface mostly and create a wrapper around serialdevice that implemented it
4979	thats a lot of code to write when the interface already exists
4981	after my application open office document programmatically in background link to it appears in quick access area in file explorer
4982	its not good thing because its not needed to share this with users
4993	enabling a custom provider in the realtime etw tracing page of windows device portal shows no details other than the timestamp for each event
4994	ive been using perfview and that works great and shows the event details payload keywords level etc
4996	i was just hoping to use the portal for realtime monitoring but it doesnt appear to be working correctly
10067	allow to developers create a custom keyboard
10414	if immediate approval is not possible then apps that have been published should be immediately available
5330	windows app store categories has tremendous potential to interact and requestthe conent consumers and content providers lack of interaction makes it less exciting
8448	now it work butthe the header of first group is not displayed
8858	if the phone doesnt have an accurate location simply return what it does have
9104	me and two friends of mine created an app that won in a windows hackathon held by microsoft cyprus
6773	so as far as i can tell the combination splitview pane pivot is the cause for this problem
7175	i submitted my word game to the apple app store
6714	please dont neglect this suggestioni am not saying to copy anyone
5840	this way the already paid for gg wifi network cable etc
7737	if before calling the method i remove the attendee it wont crash
7172	not just send a mail somewhere
5427	could you make an option in the sdk installer for just the tools
6177	currently this is not possible because when trying to add custom headers to the content using the below code
7930	please make it available also for us developers here in kenya
5445	there is what i consider a security issue in uwp applications that i feel should be addressed
6830	best regards leo
4998	not sure if this has any relevance
4999	i am working on location based apps
5000	i am using mapicon to show user current location
5001	now i want to allow the user to drag that mapicon but there is not an event to that
5005	when creating a login page i found that when placing the focus in the user name field the header and textbox added an additional box around the field to indicate focus
5006	however on the password box the field focus does not occur
5008	since webview lacks support for manipulation events it acts as a huge gesture eater which doesnt let its parent controls like scrollviewer flipview to take control of gesture like scroll swipe etc
5009	it becomes impossible to use a webview along with other xaml elements in the same view
5011	if selectionmode is none in a listview its really hard to know which item that is in focus
5013	also setting which item is in focus is hard as well
5015	if there are some better way please let me know
5016	the ways i found feels a bit clumsy
5023	i work around this by checking device family
5026	but the modern winrt network api which is based around streamsocket and the corresponding streamsocketcontrol do not provide an option to enable tcp timestamps support
5027	which is not futureproof
5028	yes i know if were c developers we can use the traditional winsock api setsockopt can do what we need but that will tied us to the old selfmanage threads model which is not pleasing
5030	rfc tells the story in much greater detail
5033	i have an app in the store to make a live tile clock
5035	i checked with multiple clock tile apps in the store and they all have this same fundamental issue
5036	blank or app logo on tile until tile notification refreshes
5038	something like what htc shipped with their windows phones
5039	in an effort to minimize overhead may the system settings could allow for only one selected clock app to be running
5047	right now creating an isolated environment fails for some installers
5051	i was able to run the converter on build and
5052	however on build i got this error
5059	weve got the clean uninstall but no applevel resets
5061	do people really launch their app and then get their file they wanted my strong experience is people find their file and then let the file type associations work for them
5063	the ftas are meant to be userchangeable
5064	currently i have to do a request to the server to check the certificates extract the public key and verify its ok
5065	currently i cannot access the handshake of the httpclient where the ssl pinning verification should be done
5067	was scratching my head wondering what was going on until i enabled verbose msbuild output
5068	seems if a specified layoutfile in appxpackagefilelist is missing a file copy is skipped and no other output occurs
5072	the vsdproj extension doesnt immediately load this value into the project property window packagelayout text box until you change your configuration from its current value to something else and back again
5074	web view is not supporting msappdatalocal uri for rendring images into web pages that are hosted in installed location
5076	a gatt notification arrives from a sensor
5077	we only get seconds to do something with it
5078	we want to tag the location but gps takes longer than that to lock
5085	its virtually impossible to tell how much you will be getting paid in paid apps and iaps
5086	the reserved amount updates daily but thats never the actual number paid out
5087	for example if you see in reserve there needs to be a way to know that you might expect about of it to be paid while the rest is held over
5088	the uwp provides a couple of options to access files and folder
5090	unfortunately access is only guaranteed via storagefile storagefolder
5091	this makes it hard to port existing codes that make intensively use of the other api
5093	right now attempt to do it using win or stdio will result in permission denied which is total nonsense basically saying that ok we give you these api options but we dare you to try to use the classical one
5101	this will make it possible to have continuous deployment process for the platform
5102	give the public yet another reason why the windows dev platform is the best
5104	currently we customizing titlebar background and foreground but border is not
5107	sometimes i only have a storagefile and i would like to launch the explorer to display that file
5108	to do so i need access to the files storagefolder and pass that to launchfolderasync
5111	i am using the raspberry pi with the nxp nfc modul
5112	several card standards are possible
5113	companies and public services using encrypted cards use a key to read data card id confidential data
5115	we have a server cloud backend as part of our product
5116	each costumer may run a different version of this backend software
5120	the sole purpose of us using the sfb is to limit what apps users can see and install
5123	actually the list of installed apps are useless is terrible just shows one app at a time
5128	xaml supports inking so that a user can handwrite directly into a textbox using ink which is then converted automatically into text
5129	this was demod in one of the apps at the build event in london
5134	actually initially i constructed the msi by placing the folder in the documents folder but the centennial does not install it there but in the vfs
5135	it will be hard for the user to find these kind of folders too
5140	i am adding some screenshots too
5141	you can install those android apps yourself
5153	now a promotional codes allows his owner to get paid aplication from the store only by
5155	discount codes are a very important marketing too which is overlooked in the store
5156	currently if an app developer submits an update to an exsiting lob app the update bypasses the business store and the app is automaticallyupdated
5158	this gives enterprises the control of when the updated app is deployed to their users ie so that is does not conflict with other updates etc
5159	support hybrid html cordova applications and windows mobile
5161	rdlc report viewer with report designer in winform apps was the easiest way to get the job done
5164	but after i deploy the sample code at my phonearmit throw this exception
5165	sample code in onedrive here
5167	thats the thread in msdn form
5169	if you try to open an file by file type association linked filetype then you will have no file access to most of the open file with this appscenarios
5170	the only way is to grant file and folder permission is by the folder picker which itself have no defaultfolder parameter
5171	so this is really terrible for an app
5173	currently it is possible to do it using winium but not possible to do using winappdriver
5174	the file explorer in device portal lets you look at dat files the ones where localsettings and roamedsettings are stored but theres no way to edit them
5176	ssml is not fully supported
5180	our users occasionally experience freezes in our current high data volume c net app that i believe is because of garbage collection
5181	having to move to c for this would mean a drop in productivity for our developers
5182	should show temperature data on device portal
5185	user cant be expected to keep the window maximized
5186	this makes sense for phones and tablet mode but for desktop and dedicated use devices its just a limitation
5187	iot supports a single app so it isnt affected but windows mobile is
5192	issues like this make it hard to use uwp in business use cases
5195	if uwp is to take over for win this is basic requirement
5199	were trying to build a solution based on windows mobile that runs a single assigned access app
5201	i can use fiddler on my desktop to view my network traffic
5203	i run the converter on powershell but it can not finish the work though it doesnt report any problems
5204	in other works it keeps running state here is the complete log
5206	attempting to choose the most recent one compatible with your version
5207	we have several instruments that implement an api via soap on linux that presents as a wcf service
5208	unfortunately we cant create uwp apps because there is no support for the custom wcf binding which is needed to talk to these instruments
5209	id love to do it
5211	centennial cmd line arguments
5212	appx shortcuts do not support command line arguments
5215	not sure if this is the right place but it seems that the makeappx commando doesnt like relsxml files as added by the vs setup
5216	i ran it multiple times yout to find the reason but it crashed with this errors every time when it got to a rels file
5233	just like an user have right for review so should developers be able to respond to each and every reviews submitted to the store
5234	if an user plans to opt out from a response from developer do not email the user a response but still allow a response to made publicly visible
5235	needless to say why because the current implementation is being exploited to submit false reviews and not allowing the developers to respond
5236	since application insights for mobile is discontinued soon the dev center analytics will be broken
5237	actually exceptions thrown by uwp apis are just painfully awful
5239	too many empty stacktraces too many an error as occurred too many approximative and vague exceptions
5240	i understand that the unnecessary javascript made winrt insanely complex to design but please
5241	exceptions are there for a reason not to just be an error has occurred message
5247	there is a cordova plugin with admob for windows phone but there is still no plugin adcontrol and specific mediation to cordova
5248	admob does not release windows phone support and has no roadmap to do it
5249	smaato has already supported w but there are not plugin developed yet
5251	this will help us bring our apps to windows phone and windows universal platform
5252	systemdiagnosticsprocessstartpath with path pointing to a folder or a html file or a txt file etc results in
5256	the only solution found was to use startinfo with explorerexe for filename and path for arguments
5259	soemthing gone wrong in one of the latest builds currently i am workong on and after picking a file or folder the app crashes
5260	sometimes it returns for a second but remains inresponsive
5261	evertying seemed to work just right few builds before now many users report me problems
5265	while debugging if you click suspend the app and vs will hang and after a while your phone will likely restart
5274	today there is a handler for newwindowrequested to create new window but there seems to be no way to handle windowclose call from javascript for example
5277	uwp singlepage app with webview as only control
5279	when app is activated webview control gets focus and receives corresponding event but the content of the webview eg html does not get a focus and documenthasfocus remains false
5280	if user clicks on the html documenthasfocus becomes true and webview receives lostfocus event
5281	expected behaviour webview focus is in sync with documenthasfocus
5283	it seems to me that the baseimage runs some sort of firstrunsetup everytime a centennial installation is executed
5285	wouldnt it be better to call this firstrunsetup once and apply it to the base setup
5289	give us a print function for the uwp webview control
5291	problems mediaplayer class play audio will delay s
5293	audio file length less than or s will not playing
5295	so i did some research i decompile one of those app and found it used mediaplayer class for playing audio filethen i wrote a demo and the same problem did occur
5296	but i dont have enough evidence to prove that
5297	it will be great appreciated that anyone see this will help me vote it up so microsoft can aware and fix itit is really important for those who learning english and looking up vocabularies frequently in daily life
5298	thank you very much
5308	i currently use the codedui testing framework as it allows me to logon to ie as a different userpassword
5309	the sites that we test use windows authentication and aspnet impersonation as they run on an intranet
5310	we do not use basic authentication so cannot pass credentials on the url
5313	this means that we are forces to use the codedui framework
5322	windows app store categories has tremendous potential to interact and request
5338	scenario we have a red thats an integral part of our identity
5339	our users are asking for transparent tiles including primary tile
5341	this leaves us in a bad place where we have to either sacrifice our branding or dont provide the required functionality
5342	proposed solution have an independent color setting for storespecific branding
5343	currently didnt support unicode
5344	i made a simple test code using korean language
5345	and exception is raised
5351	if we look at appxthe new installation mechanism as a much saner version of app installation then the more applications it allows the better
5353	my example an interactive screen sharing app
5355	as far as i know this wouldnt be possible with centennial as it exists today but these kinds of apps are still valuable
5359	centennial takes big steps towards that but id like to go even further
5363	not just months
5368	i have a style targeting a fonticon control with a setter for the fontfamily
5376	the open source platform ionic has such a market place and i think its great
5382	there exist a couple of uwp libraries but their purpose is not to show beautifully designed apps implementing the material design principles of the framework
5388	as of now uielementclip accepts only rectanglegeometry in uwp applications
5392	when uwp app has a splash screen with transparent background color declared in the app manifest desktop renders the accent color while phone renders the background color
5395	i belongs to india and want to register my self in microsoft developer
5396	i need to pay life time registration fee for this
5397	when try to pay my fee there is only one option to make payment which is credit card
5398	no more options are there
5399	i do not have credit card therefore unable to make payment
5401	i have all these things but does not have only credit card and cause of only this minor reason i am unable to make payment
5414	when games get released on steam valve promotes the game for free by displaying it to mln users
5416	earlier there was option to cumulative download of all the app and now there is now way i can see total number of app downloads till date
5418	a report specially to know how many users have updated to a specific version of the app
5421	on some of my computers i only need the tools for phone deployment such as winappdeploycmd
5423	i dont code on all these machines i only need the tools
5424	i copied the tools out separately and they are only mb
5425	they work fine without the headers and libraries installed
5436	this feature is really usefull in messaging apps
5440	is it the right place to report bugs to microsoft
5441	why do we need to call bug reports new ideas
5444	administrator i am listing this one as a bug because i consider it a existing security issue that can be exploited at present but please feel free to categorize it however you see fit as always
5448	therefore malicious parties could use any urllocation they would like under their control for the webauthenticationbrokerauthenticate calls to phish the credentials of users of this process as users do not seeunderstand the url in which the process is loading the content for the authentication workflow and therefore cannot validate its authenticity
5450	for context here are the steps as i understand them that can be used to exploit this process
5460	that is where your creativity comes in
5465	if it works pass the user on to the real sign in page or better yet simply set cookies on the users session that makes it seem all is ok
5467	rule planet earth with your newfound powers ok i made this one up
5468	for reference this is based on a thread started in the msdn forums which you can see here for additional information
5470	thank you for any consideration
5476	adding developer revenue or iap price info to response will allow developers to receive accurate data about their income in requested period
5487	so i can get the sid or the groups of the user
5488	most companies want to control the access of the user by the active directory
5489	the enterprise application uses this information whether a user got access or not
5491	please help us out
5493	we are an isv who live in out of the united states
5494	when we want to set app price dev center offers by us dolloar for base price
5495	previous version of dev center was able to set by local currency
5496	this is degraded
5497	usd is not familiar for us
5498	we use different local currency basically
5499	there is no conversion list between usd and local currency
5500	microsoft sometimes changes conversion rate due to foreign exchange conversion rate
5501	because of this it is hard to find expected price by our local currency
5504	conversion rate seems not constant because of this it is hard to find our expected price
5525	i have certificate in user storage and app storage with same issuer and subject but with different eku fields
5526	certificate in user storage is filtered out and thats the one i am interested in
5527	i need to check if its installed already or not and function checking it returned false because of this and i ended up installing new one every time
5528	and none of those duplicates are listed
5532	today the ui designer could not work because it cannot parse the node
5545	currently the ratesreviews user submitted in win insider preview will be disabled later
5546	and if devs respond to that reviews it will also be deleted
5547	this is ridiculous behavior for both users and devs
5548	if ms will disable ratesreviews sent from win ip disallow users to ratereview
5549	improvements to windows store apps and games visibility
5551	currently it is not possible to export the app download statistics automatically via an api in the windows dev center
5555	currently microsoft doesnt have any specific support for beacons
5556	beacons are the next generation rulers in the market
5557	as a windows developer i dont see a good future for windows here
5558	when ever i contact any manufacturer of beacons they basically hesitate to support windows because the limitation in the windows featurest
5559	we dont have any separate library for beacons
5560	beacon also considered as normal bluetooth device
5561	currently i can only read that too has many limitations i cant communicate
5562	this is a big drawback
5563	we expected this will be solved in windows but not yet
5564	till now many clients for my company left out windows and they moved to ios and android
5565	if this is going to continue then windows will face huge drawback
5566	i have raised many questions related to this in community forum
5567	there was no input from there
5568	im not sure you guys will have a look on this quickly or not
5569	even if you have a look i am not sure about your priority
5570	windows wings are currently cut down in this area
5583	in wpf you can use textures and patterns for your app background with the tilebrush class
5584	since imagebrush inherits from tilebrush there is a missed property tile
5587	in windows forms it is easy to have users print without a dialog and to code the printer output to use a specific paper bin
5588	this functionality is missing in uwp
5589	one of our applications has users print checks from a shared check printer with the check stock in tray
5590	users as sites do this and it has worked fine in vb for the last years
5591	now that we want to upgrade the applications to a modern environment we find that uwp does not do it and wpf makes it hard leaving only winforms
5592	right now you can not register them forever
5594	for example the pro extension stands usually for a better version of the same app from the same developer
5595	but if someone else uses this it is misleading
5613	i am working in multinational company
5616	it is always the accent color and cannot be changed
5619	currently the windows blog commenting system suffers from a myriad of problems
5625	conversely with disqus you get the following benefits
5631	a blog post has been created to discuss these issues at length and you can read that here
5634	thank you for any consideration and dialogue around this idea
5644	this is ridiculous
5645	also and perhaps more importantly developers need this
5646	do you know how many hoops i have to jump though to make an app that simply takes photos and puts them on a network location too many
5649	it is crazy that such basic functionality is not currently supported almost every device on the planet supports this other than windows phone
5650	what makes this even more important is the fact that it is already supported in uwp apps when they are running on desktop laptops and tablets
5651	but the same file picker on phone is just missing this universal functionality
5661	i am having difficulty testing an in app purchase that is successful with microsofts servers yet somehow my app never receives that success message
5663	we have made a private test app and we use real money to test iap
5664	this makes it hard to test when there is a cost to every test we perform
5665	i would prefer to be able to test iap hundreds of times without having to attempt to get a refund for thousands of dollars
5666	this is currently not possible to test using currentappsimulator
5667	apple and google also provide such a sandbox environment where iap does not cost real money
5677	i have a parent application that stores files within app space
5678	now when i wish to open a file the launcher asks me to choose a target application
5681	myapp has a file abcpdf
5682	on opening the file abcpdf from myapp the launcher provides a list of applications that can open this file
5683	assuming i choose pdf reader i want myapp to know when pdf reader has closed or stopped accessing my file ie abcpdf
5687	code analysis will often warn if you expose a properlty as a uri using a string type can be ignored but ca is giving a fair warning here i feel
5689	i would like to see systemuri supported natively by the runtime when making a binding like this
5690	also as a side note the conversion from string breaks throws an exception if a bound string is null or empty however a string that is nonempty and not a valid uri doesnt throw
5698	however if you have a pin on your system it treats that as a biometric device as well
5699	this is not what the documentation indicates
5700	userconsentverifier should not treat a pin as a biometric device
5702	right now when displaying online web page in windows webview the hsts security feature is not working
5703	also the webview allows scripts from any source to load even though the page is loaded via https
5706	see these pages for testing hsts and mixed content
5713	i need support for ios the actual app has a lot of problems
5716	more like angularjs style
5718	the old one is to verbose
5721	unfortunately the glyph activity is never displayed on the tile
5722	but when i am using any other glyph such as alarm alert attention it is properly displayed
5727	thanks and best regards
5729	we are migrating an application from windows to windows
5730	the first problem that we encountred is that in winrt enables to add an service reference of wcf and in uwp is not yet implemented
5731	currently its a mixture of some taxes are collected by ms some have to get paid by the developer
5732	as a smaller business this is a huge effort and only theoretically possible
5734	as far as i am informed the competition apple app store google play does this aswell
5735	also ms used to collect more taxes than nowadays
5736	look at this old feature request quoting an older developer agreement
5740	it states any current member country of the european union which includes eg
5742	nowadays jan th the dev agreements lists austria as a country which the developer has to collect the taxes
5744	austria price being selected is the final sale price and includes any applicable taxes
5757	i need it to keep the app title bar background is the same with accent color
5758	on windows mobile for mobile connections calling getsignalbars on a mobile connection always returns even if the bars displayed by the system are any other value
5759	its working on wifi connection and on both type of connections on windows
5760	is this a bug or something changed in wm
5761	maxpath is giving me a severe headache lately
5762	ive been trying to compile some stuff and the compiler is necessarily creating processes with enormous arguments
5763	everything would be fine but maxpath is too short to let it succeed
5764	this is the only reason ive got to switch to linux as i am not in a position to change maxpath or rewrite the way the compiler calls processes
5765	please microsoft help
5770	the generated bindings code is very large and not easy to follow
5771	further it doesnt even exist until compilation and even then isnt visible to the user in vs
5773	need timeout on read from streamsocket just like with old net sockets and serialport
5774	now you have destroy the complete connection if a device on a bluetooth serial connection does not respond
5775	while this makes no sense at all
5776	there nothing wrong with the connection it is just a serial device not responding
5777	javascript provides a history api with which you can manipulation certain aspects of the browsing history
5778	for example historyreplacestate replaces the url of the current website in the browsing history
5779	however it is not possible to detect these changes in webview without injecting javascript to replace the funtion calls
5780	this solution is quite hacky and a lot of work
5781	about of my apps can not be found in the store
5782	i have about apps and around are visible
5783	even if i click on the developer name it still does not show all my apps
5784	if i do a deep link then yes it find the apps and you can download them but it wont find them with keywords or app name
5785	this is the same issue for all windows stores
5787	every version of windows does not show my apps
5788	i actually had one of my apps appear and then disappear a day later
5789	this is unacceptable and is a strong deterrent to creating apps for windows
5795	phone phone windows and windows
5800	inbrowser deployment was an excellent feature of silverlight
5801	while most organizations will allow instore apps its still going to be very inconvenient to deploy apps through the app store for many reasons
5802	firstly deployment in the app store requires rigorous testing etc from microsoft when the app users wont even be the general public
5805	secondly we have many versions of the same application deployed to different customers
5817	read email access locally is very important to create professional and amazing apps for uwp apps please allow us to achieve this
5821	we need set it in codes
5825	http request includes get or post requesturl and body
5826	while android and ios can do it
5830	after changing to fullscreen and back the position of the window is wrong and not to influence right
5833	i just found that reading the property of systemcomment from a file doesnt work on windows
5834	i used storagefilepropertiesgetdocumentpropertiesasync to read the properties of a file that has comment but documentpropertiescomment is a empty string
5835	same problem happens to windows explorer set a new comment then apply to the file but when you read again theres nothing
5838	currently windows os decides the best internet connection and uses it automatically if i have more than one connection like wifi and network cable
5842	uwp still lags all features of regular ado to connect to any db
5843	using ef will only provide direct access to sqllite and not regular dbs
5844	ms shall change ef to allow db connectivity via batch data return like return records at a time instead of select returning entire dbtable data in one shot
5846	it appears there is a enter file name even when selecting an existing file using filesavepicker on uwp mobile
5847	it seems to work as expected on desktop
5848	you can see my original question on msdn forum below
5852	winjs was designed prior to es
5853	some of the capabilities are now provided by es such as classses would not have to be provided by winjs
5855	edge browser vs and vs code already provides support for es
5859	unfortunately it is also buginfested and lacks fundamental features expected from a graphical debugging tool in
5867	the solution is opensourcing windbg and related tools dbghlp windbg extensions etc which will allow the community to fix and improve what the rather small team at microsoft doesnt manage to
5880	at the moment it is impractical for me as a developer to keep asking my boss for his microsoft account just to create app packages
5882	i have posted my st application on windows store with keywords
5890	for eg in publisher name or in application name whole word partial word and so on
5905	the app knows that it is a totaly newclear situation
5909	scenario user save a file app is closed directory is deletedrenamed next time dlg save file
5922	currently its difficult to do some of these things
5923	nesting uicontainers inside of a richtextblock to add border elements needed for this ruins the alignment of text
5926	inexplicably the uwp does not include the wpf wrappanel that was introduced nearly years ago
5928	there are other panels in the uwp that do something similar like the wrapgrid but this doesnt work well if the items are variable size
5930	one simple example where the wrappanel is essential is when displaying a tag cloud
5940	there appears to be no way to deploy an app to a windows emulator outside of manually doing so in visual studio
5943	without that we have no means to wrap our own tooling to launch and install built apps to the emulator
5945	oddly with windows tooling installed and windows sdk we can actually see the list of windows emulators listed in the appdeploycmd output and need to do some postfiltering to separate the and emulators
5946	so currently we can use the tooling to get the list of emulators but if we try to deploy to them theyll start up but app deployment will fail
5958	today i opened the windows dev account payout report i found up my advertising and my purchased app already separate into two
5959	why this happen
5961	i developed the app bizview a google analytics client with the same features of official google analytics app in the android store
5972	this question is not because bizview is my own app the question is for all developers that works hard
5984	after some diagnosis i found that the issue is caused by the api not handling pdf files encrypted with aes encryption that the later acrobat versions use
5987	when dragdropping filesfolders onto universal apps the readonly attribute is set making it impossible to edit those filesfolders
5990	after all dragdrop is a conscious user interaction like a picker and does not happen without their knowledge
5991	apis do not support the configuration of the window background colour
5992	this means that if like groove music an app uses a nonwhite background a noticable section of white appears when a window is dragged to a new size
5995	the link above is a sway that explains my suggestion better than i can do so here
5996	i sincerely hope it makes a difference
6009	unfortunately neither the smartcard class nor the smartcardprovisioning class nor any other related class provides a means of retrieving the friendly name later
6021	allow thirdparty apps to manipulate dom elements
6037	it looks as if the return value of
6038	windowssystempowerenergysaverstatus
6041	regardless of a threshold set in the energy saver settings
6042	looks like a bug
6043	im using a lumia device with windows mobile build
6044	could someone please have a look into this
6047	it is frustrated for a devoloper then an app isnt show in any category and the app can only find per direct search by name
6054	i have released several versions of the app yet i cannot find the number of new users or the number of existing users who have upgraded to the new app version in the dev center
6055	i hope i can set my app price is but i cant now
6056	currently there is no way to schedule recurring notifications using scheduledtoastnotification
6058	but this is simply not an elegant solution
6067	all win mac linux have apis to do so but uwp doesnt
6069	when you have a text editor with unsaved changes the standard behavior is to ask the user what to do before closing
6070	this is not possible on uwp
6074	today i have run into a problem with combobox control
6075	the issue can be easily reproduced
6076	i have two rows and two columns
6077	left column takes as much space as possible and i place the combobox into the right column
6078	i populate the combobox with a few items and run the app
6079	i maximize the window open the combobox popup selection menu minimize and i see the popup moved to the middle of the window
6082	showat show the flyout with the size width defined in the style
6083	however showatasync show the flyout with the with of the element passed in parameter and ignore the style
6084	i think its a bug
6087	i would prefer it return a boolean or an enum with the fail reason
6088	probably when the location is outside the camera frustum
6094	currently we have to test if the returned points is inside the rect with a size of mapactualwidth and mapactualheight
6095	if the point is outside we have to divide the result by rawpixelsperviewpixel
6097	a point with a location near the top right corner of the map and inside the map will have an offset of
6098	if the location is slightly on the right the returned point will be instead of you have to divide it by a factor of on my lumia
6108	this can be seen in settings page
6110	some apps dont work in background well
6111	downloads may breaks when apps switched
6121	currently when the publisher name is chosen during signup a publisher id is derived from that
6122	this publisher id is then used to name the app packages and the apps localstorage folder
6123	if you are careless during signup you are stuck and cant change the publisher id and therefore that naming of your packages
6128	super fastest calling with home button shortcut
6130	just press key on locked screen for seconds for phone call profile change etcrun application
6133	why can i not assign torunapplication for some button on locked screen
6134	why can i not assign torunapplication for some screenregion on locked screen
6146	home automation is a huge market for windows devices
6147	a big piece of this is being able to monitorcontrol ip cameras such as the foscam hd cameras
6149	right now we can only inspect the server certificate after a request was done by using requestmessagetransportinformation
6152	but unfortunately this is application wide and so all certificates of all services of websites that might be called in the app must be included
6153	seems like there is a problem with a popup which seems to overlap the application bar
6154	the strange is that when we open the appbar it seems to be partially covered
6155	ive observed it on bot desktop and mobile uwp app
6156	more description and sample code you can find here
6157	my app has no choice submit audit report feedback audit failure
6159	example an app that allows users to select a time ie tomorrow am to do something
6160	user can also choose to run everyday every week etc
6166	this feature is available on android i heard even on iphone
6181	since the above code does not set a well known header the above code results in an exception misused header name
6192	my company and thousands of others use sketch to develop app interfaces that we then give to our developers
6195	there is currently no way how to display in webview https web page with invalid certificate even with user specific optin
6198	currently there is no such provision and all of employees who are coding and publishing apps easily know the revenue earned
6199	more i earn more chances they will leave and start publishing their own apps
6201	both apple and google allows us to create user accounts with release manager role who has no access to salesrevenue reports
6202	in windows mobile any thirdparty app can act as a callerid app to intercept the call and set the phonecallorigin
6203	but other apps cannot access phonecallorigin from phonecallhistoryentry
6204	when developing coded ui test for a localized uwp apps test becomes dependent on texts that are localized
6205	on most controls this can easily be handled by an automationid but on the corewindow and messagebox incl buttons you cannot set any automationids so the coded ui test has the use the title to find the elements
6208	ive two apps with same name one is in phone and the other one is in desktop
6209	now i created a universal app
6210	tab version have a small number of users i need to upload new universal package to the phone version app
6211	but the problem is the app name automatically reserved to the tab version and the package name also
6212	im not able to associate the application with the phone build in the storebecause the app name is not reserved to this there is no package name or package id for this in the store
6213	how can i resolve this issue without changing the name of the phone build
6228	see below the template of my button and the two different renderings
6233	other strange differences did show up as well especially in grids but the example above is the craziest one
6234	please tell me if you want some details about other mismatches
6235	ive developed application which targets windows phone
6236	when xap is deployed on win mobile device it has some strange bug
6237	after reinstalling the app uninstall deploy applications data stays the same it isnt removed after unstalling the app
6238	but when i retarget the app to windows pone problem disappears
6252	however when the barcode is generated it will generate this code as image
6258	i can then enter the encoded image into the above mentioned decoder and it will decode correctly
6272	i can then enter the encoded image into the above mentioned decoder and it will decode more
6274	remote desktop services objects for windows store apps are no longer available for use as of windows and windows server technical preview
6280	negative reviews are bad especially when users rated an old version of the app which will then turn down new users
6289	back in windows phone silverlighttimes i was able to get the content of the cameraroll much faster via the medialibrary second for the same amount of files
6290	how can it be that this became so extremely slow with the uap
6291	in silverlight it was once possible to register an app as an option for the edit picker in the photo hub
6292	this is not possbile for uap apps
6294	this option is already present in the desktop variant of the app but missing in the mobile app
6299	the equivalent winrt api messagedialog provides no apparent means to copy the message to clipboard no response to right click no response to ctrlc
6305	thanks for your attention
6309	ive got a win app in the store
6310	i want to beta test a win version of it
6311	so i set the app to hide stop selling
6312	i then submit the win version and get some promo codes
6313	watching my app analytics i see far more devices now have my win app than i intended because updates still get pushed regardless of the listing settings
6326	if you are professional developer redesign your company loves this word the formal business invoice
6334	when microsoft sends a money between the company for your business partner for example outsourced call center do you use credit card for such payment
6340	it could be something like
6341	for input nodes
6351	it would be very very appreciated
6357	i have made an app when i search for it apps pops up and my app isnt any of them
6358	i just chatted to support they told me that it was because the name was too generic
